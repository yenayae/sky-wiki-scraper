As their memory unfolds, the Anxious Angler, accompanied by the Abyss Guide, can be seen going out fishing along the rocks. The Anxious Angler tosses a net into the water and comes up with a decent haul of fish while the Abyss Guide watches closely with a bucket in hand. The Anxious Angler then rushes ahead, leaving the Abyss Guide behind as they stretch out an arm, as if to say, \"Wait up!\" Now alone and vulnerable, the Anxious Angler tenses up as they realize that something sinister has drawn near - a Dark Dragon, cruising along in the shallows behind them. At the end of the memory, the Anxious Angler tenses up further, fearfully glancing over their shoulder as they anticipate the worst... but they go unnoticed by the Dark Dragon, and they heave a gusty sigh of relief.",

Once they've made enough swings to the felling notch, the humongous tree comes crashing down - and nearly crushes another nearby Spirit.

Together, they make their way out of the cave and up the hill, pausing to take a rest partway through the climb. Continuing onward, the Spirits reach the bell tower at the peak of the island. At the end of the memory, the Applauding Bellmaker's companion climbs the bell tower to install the new bell.

This Spirit has a standard memory with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Ascetic Monk can be seen building three structures resembling cairns, carefully pilling stones on top of each other to form a triangle. Once completed, they strike a meditative pose at the center and concentrate to balance the rocks - but a strong wind knocks the Spirit off their feet, causing the structures to collapse on themselves. Undeterred, they start over and build the structures back up, once again attempting to achieve balance. At the end of the memory, the Ascetic Monk is in harmony with the wind, keeping all three monuments in balance at the same time. However, their concentration soon breaks, and the three monuments fall yet again. Discouraged by the situation, the Ascetic Monk slumps in defeat and lets their arms fall."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Beckoning Ruler can be seen attempting to boss around some Birds which have gathered in different spots on their Crown Island. Some Birds pay the Spirit no mind, while others fly away as they approach. The Beckoning Ruler then strides over to a row of stone statues depicting soldiers holding their swords high in the air, and motion them to move several times. At the end of the memory, the Beckoning Ruler sits on their throne and looks to their left at one of the statues. They stand up to beckon to the statue, but after no response from it, the Spirit walks over and demandingly points at the statue and then towards the ground, motioning them to move once again. The Little Prince enters the scene and asks, \"You know they can't move, right?\" \"I am entitled to command their obedience! My orders are reasonable,\" the Spirit replies before turning back towards the statue. \"From now on, stay where you are.\" Raising a hand to his chin, the Little Prince contemplates aloud, \"Grown-ups are so strange.\"",

As the memories progress, the child progresses from being a young kid to an adult and the Bereft Veteran gets older. The child soon leaves home on their own to become a soldier, holding a spear in their hand as they wave goodbye. On a snowy day, the Bereft Veteran sits on a chair inside their home when a soldier comes knocking at their door. They show the Veteran a notice and it is apparent that they've lost their child to the war. Filled with grief, the Bereft Veteran is left standing, crumpled over, next to the Chimes that the two installed together many years ago. At the end of the memory, the Bereft Veteran looks at the Chimes in front of them, remembering their forever-lost child and mourning them with one hand on their heart and the other touching their forehead."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 4 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. Players use the set of two switches to open the grate. Then, they can fly up to an elevated switch on the right to bring down a moving platform on the other side of the cave. This leads players down a hallway to another set of switches to unlock a sealed butterfly jar. Once the seal is burned, the butterflies flutter to the center of the room where the Spirit once stood. A Deep Call amongst the butterflies causes them to lift the player up and through the hole in the ceiling. As their memory unfolds, the Boogie Kid can be seen opening their arms wide, looking up at the stream of light coming from the hole above, before running towards a tunnel which leads to the top of the island in the clouds. Across the small lake at the top of the island, the Boogie Kid looks up, with arms wide open, at the swarm of butterflies dancing about. At the end of the memory, the Boogie Kid does a little dance in place with their arms loosely lifted up at their sides. The player steps closer, grabs a bell from underneath their cape and rings it, causing the Boogie Kid to stop. They bring their hand to their chin and think for a short while, before they raise up their arm in epiphany, with a glowing exclamation mark blinking above their head.",

As their memory unfolds, the Bumbling Boatswain, accompanied by the Abyss Guide, can be seen going scavenging for resources that might help them do repairs on the ship. They find some wooden boards near a broken boat and take them back to the ship. Back on the ship, the Bumbling Boatswain promptly walks into a stick from a canopy tent before the Abyss Guide can warn them, making the planks they've collected fall onto their head. They rub their head in pain while the Abyss Guide reaches out to them, concerned.

This Spirit has a standard memory with 7 memory fragments and an unlimited overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Cackling Cannoneer can be seen carrying a harpoon gun and sauntering up the slope with the Abyss Guide, who carries a rolled-up target sheet. They stop at a broken wall to prepare for what seems like target practice. The Cannoneer gestures the Abyss Guide to hurry ahead to nail the target sheet to a faraway wall before running back to take cover. Once the two Spirits are safely out of the way, the Cackling Cannoneer takes aim and shoots - hitting the bullseye dead-on. The two Spirits go and observe the target sheet, happy with the shot. At the end of the memory, the Abyss Guide punches the air in delight while the Cackling Cannoneer throws their head back and arms halfway up while laughing heartily and gleefully, pleased by the incredibly successful shot.",

The Caring Companion will also follow the player around in the area, though they will disappear when transitioning to another sub-area or teleporting home. The Manatee Emote Menu can be opened by selecting the inline_text icon at the bottom of the screen. Petting will make the Manatee fly up in front of the player's avatar, before they pet its head. Cuddle will make the player's avatar sit down and pat on their lap, before the Manatee flies to them, lies down on their back, and gets patted on the belly. Down will make the player's avatar make a downward motion with their hand, after which the Manatee sits down in front of them. Using the inline_text Expression will make the Manatee get out of their sitting position and come to the player."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 8 memory fragments and an unlimited overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Ceasing Commodore and the Abyss Guide can be seen going on a search for black crystals. On their search through the island, they spot two crystals at different places, and assemble them in a bucket the Abyss Guide carries, while the Commodore looks for new findings. A bit further on their way, the two adventurers spot another crystal at the top of a tower. The Abyss Guide immediately tries to climb up the wall, but the Ceasing Commodore calmly stops them, volunteering to scale the tower instead. The remaining memory fragments may be a little difficult to gather if you don’t have enough Cape Power, as they are placed high up on the tower wall. Use a Deep Call to summon the nearby butterflies, and let yourself be carried up the tower, where a Light Bloom on the wall can be used to recharge your Wings and help you stay there. At the end of the memory, the Ceasing Commodore calms the Abyss Guide's determination to climb the tower. Executing what the Abyss Guide had intended to do, the Ceasing Commodore later hangs from the top ledge of the tower, triumphantly holding the large crystal above their head, while the Abyss Guide, watching from below, jumps up delight.",

This Spirit has a carry Spirit memory with 10 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. During the memory, the Spirit must be carried through the depths of the cave, up a winding path leading to a Child of Light, and then back out again. This cave is home to many Dark Crabs so repeated Deep Calls are recommended to prevent them from knocking players out of the Spirit's circle. As their memory unfolds, the Chill Sunbather can be seen exploring the cave at a leisurely pace alongside the Sanctuary Guide, seeming unconcerned about the danger presented by the Dark Crabs. As the Spirit makes their way up the spiraling path towards its end, a mischievous pair of Crabs scuttle away with the Chill Sunbather's hat and sunglasses, prompting an alarmed Sanctuary Guide to chase after them to retrieve the stolen items. Unbothered by the theft, the Chill Sunbather continues traveling, eventually making their way back outside of the cave's entrance. At the end of the memory, the Chill Sunbather stands within the cave at the bottom of the winding path, relaxed and idly scratching their belly despite missing both their cape along with their hat and sunglasses. The Sanctuary Guide jogs up to the Spirit to hand over the recovered items, which the Chill Sunbather accepts with little fanfare. Dressed once again in their tropical attire, the Spirit returns to idly scratching their belly as the Sanctuary Guide shakes their head with exasperation.",

The Daydream Forester is also located on the outside of this treehouse; the Chuckling Scout and the Daydream Forester can be found on opposite sides of the structure. This Spirit has a standard memory with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. Be wary while reliving this memory because the Spirit can be damaged by the polluted rain. Be quick to collect the fragments and make sure to bring a friend to recharge. As their memory unfolds, the Chuckling Scout and the Daydream Forester can be seen walking around the perimeter of the treehouse, on the far side of the small stream. The two appear to be gathering sticks before Daydream Forester is distracted from the task and wanders off. The Chuckling Scout follows their friend, sneaking along behind their fellow, preoccupied, Spirit. The Daydream Forester does not seem to notice the Chuckling Scout following along behind them, striking funny poses. At the end of the memory, the Chuckling Scout silently stands behind the Daydream Forester, waiting for the other Spirit to finally notice them. Not realizing that the Chuckling Scout had been following behind them the entire time, the Forester turns around and jumps in alarm. After their sneaky surprise, the Chuckling Scout lets out a small chuckle, shaking their head in amusement.",

Alternatively, players can use the momentum of the slide to launch into flight and steer towards the cliff. As their memory unfolds, the Confident Sightseer is seen helping a young Spirit climb the tall ledges along the sides of the Ice Rink. They encourage their small companion to cross the thin arch that stretches between a gap in the cliff before stopping to admire the dazzling view that awaits them at their final destination. At the end of the memory, the young Spirit sits to play in the sand as the Confident Sightseer stands nearby, still admiring the view. They then turn to call the young Spirit over, holding their arms out to pick up them up in a hug. The Confident Sightseer lifts the young Spirit onto their shoulders and turns to face the Ice Rink, taking in the golden landscape that stretches before them.",

Beware the many Dark Crabs along the route and the single Dark Dragon patrolling the shipwreck. Repeated Deep Calls are recommended to prevent Crabs from knocking you out of the Spirit's circle. As their memory unfolds, the Crab Whisperer can be seen traveling cautiously across the inhospitable landscape, braving the dangers of Dark Creatures to search the wreckage of the giant ship. Eventually, the Spirit finds their way up the pipes that climb the back wall of the area - where at the top, the fallen body of another Spirit lies buried in the sand.

Once at the bottom of the slope, they find the little Skater sitting in the snow by the rink with their head dropped. Seeing this, the Dancing Performer puts down the jar and pulls out their Lute to play a little tune, capturing the little Skater's attention and lifting their sad mood. With their confidence regained, they join the Dancing Performer to dance on the ice rink as the older Spirit continues to strum an upbeat song. At the end of the memory, the Dancing Performer demonstrates a dance with sweeping motions to the applause of the little Skater, teaching them some moves to copy and learn for their final performance at the Coliseum.",

As their memory unfolds, the Daydream Forester can be seen trailing behind the Chuckling Scout, who is gathering sticks. Daydream Forester follows the Chuckling Scout across the small stream and blows bubbles during their walk. The Forester then follows a particularly large bubble towards the edge of a small cliff at the edge of the area, not noticing the drop-off in front of them. Chuckling Scout leaps after the Daydream Forester and grabs them by the ankle to prevent them from walking off the edge of the cliff. The two Spirits recover under a nearby tree. At the end of the memory, the two Spirits trek back to the smaller treehouse together. The Daydream Forester is distracted by another large bubble and the Chuckling Scout giggles at the sight.",

As they raise their staff, radiating with energy, the missing parts of the mask emerge to complete it, finally regaining their former glory. Now standing tall and proud, the Elder notices the small kid (you), kneeling and looking up at them. You exchange nods with them. With a wave of their staff, the Elder redirects the flight of birds into the sky. Back at the temple, the doors open and the birds swoop into the now illuminated room."

The Elder picks up the candle flame and brings it up to their chest, which causes their robe to illuminate. Re-energized, the Elder molds a butterfly with the flame between their hands. The glowing butterfly flies away making a circle around the little child (you), but comes back to rest on the Elder's shoulder. The Elder offers the big jar to the butterfly and it flies inside. They place the jar squarely on the altar. Back at the temple, all the jars in the room suddenly explode with sparkles of light and fill the room with butterflies."

The child (you) turns around to see a figure standing alert in the distance, holding a radiant stick to their side. The Twins step apart in an theatrical reveal and show off by striking their synchronized poses, twirling their paddles, and performing flips. They take a giant leap and jump over the child. The Twin with the bobbed hair kneels and holds out their hand. Seeing this, the Twin with the spiky hair takes a step forward to extend their hand further towards the child, but is immediately cut off by the first Twin. Using their paddle, the second Twin hits the flame out of the child's hands and catches it, while the other Twin and child follow in pursuit. The second Twin dodges a swing by the other Twin with a great leap and lobs the flame once again. The flame rebounds off the child's failed catch back to the second Twin. This short-lived game of cat-and-mouse ends with the second Twin launching the flame out of the coliseum."

The Elder picks up the octahedron and brings it up to their face with their eyes closed briefly. They hold out the octahedron to the child and nod, signaling for the child to do the same. The child complies and the flame enters the octahedron. The Elder hands the child the dimly glowing octahedron. Looking up, the child releases the octahedron as it floats up into the darkness. Against the starry background, the camera pans down towards an dim octahedron. It fills up with light. Each of the realm's constellations radiate out and transform into beautiful murals, depicting each Elder's story. After the final Vault constellation mural is revealed, all the Elders appear standing in line (from left to right: Forest, Wasteland, Vault, Prairie, Isle, and Valley). The Vault Elder lowers their arms and the murals fade away behind them. One at a time, all of them but the Vault Elder slowly kneel before you. The camera pans up towards a constellation in the shape of a crown. It transforms into a kneeling royal holding a floating orb in front of a castle and pillars."

The two talk together on the bench, and a mask and a book are propped up against the bench next to the Storyteller. The Storyteller soon has to say goodbye, and begins to walk away before the Modest Dancer calls them over since they had forgotten the extra mask they brought. The Forgetful Storyteller thanks them and continues towards the stage. Modest Dancer then realizes that Storyteller forgot their book as well, and is seen chasing after the Storyteller to return it to them. The Forgetful Storyteller turns to the Dancer as they present the forgotten book, thankful for the Dancer's help. At the end of the memory, the Dancer returns the book with a flourish, and the Forgetful Storyteller presses their palms agains their cheek in an adoring \"Awww\" expression."

As their memory unfolds, the Frantic Stagehand can be seen carrying a large pile of props over to the Village Theater's stage. The Mellow Musician is seen leaning against a nearby building, and watches as the Stagehand drops a small item. The Stagehand walks back to pick up the fallen item, and continues on their way. After this, they drop a much bigger prop, and Musician rushes over to help pick up the larger prop. The two Spirits both carry the props together, sharing the workload for the rest of the walk. At the end of the memory, the two Spirits pause for a moment after dropping off the props near the backstage entrance. The Musician wipes their forehead, and Stagehand dusts off their hands. The Frantic Stagehand then extends a hand to the Mellow Musician, and the two gently shake hands."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 7 memory fragments and a 10-minute time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Gloating Narcissist can be seen enthusiastically performing for an empty amphitheater. At first, they strike dramatic poses on a floating boat that from one side of the stage to the other. Afterwards, the Spirit dismounts to pose directly in front of the various mirrors that populate the stands. Lastly, the Gloating Narcissist ends the performance by taking a bow at center stage. At the end of the memory, the Spirit pumps up the nonexistent crowd by gesturing widely, in hopes of generating a stronger response. The Little Prince enters the scene clapping, promoting the Gloating Narcissist to announce, \"A traveler from afar is here to admire me. I am the handsomest, best-dressed, richest, and most intelligent man on the island.\" Confused, the Little Prince looks around the empty amphitheater and replies, \"But you're the only man here.\" As if they didn't hear anything, the Gloating Narcissist continues to hype up the nonexistent crowd, calling for them to \"Please keep applauding!\" The Little Prince obliges and contemplates aloud, \"The grown-ups are certainly very odd.\"",

As their memory unfolds, the Grateful Shell Collector can be seen making their way through the main island, looking for seashells to collect. The Spirit spots one shell at the bottom of the cave, then goes up to the higher opening in the cave, where they meet the waving Sanctuary Guide, standing next to another shell. The two Spirits then venture into one of the long and winding tunnels above the cave mouth, making their way down the slide. After they exit the tunnel, the Sanctuary Guide offers a shell to the Grateful Shell Collector. At the end of the memory, the Grateful Shell Collector and the Sanctuary Guide stand in the shallow water of the beach, keeping an eye out for more seashells. The Sanctuary Guide then approaches the other Spirit with another discovered shell. The Grateful Shell Collector bows their head and shakes their clasped hands in thanks.",

This Spirit memory can be challenging to complete, as it involves navigating between moving platforms to collect each memory fragment. It is technically possible to complete this memory without flying (as shown in the video), although it will be of much help if the player has enough Cape Energy. It is possible to travel across the whole structure by jumping between platforms and by waiting for each pair of platforms to come together and jump at the point of closest approach. If the player has enough Cape Energy and means to recharge (such as a friend or an Instant Recharge Spell), this memory can also be completed by flying. As their memory unfolds, the Greeting Shaman can be seen dancing on moving platforms of varying altitudes, striking different poses along the way. At the end of the memory, the Greeting Shaman acknowledges the player by punching one fist into the flat palm of their other hand and motioning it forwards.",

It was a Season Pass exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node ( total). The player is standing up while playing and clanging on the bell with large arms movement just like the Small Bell. Both bells have similar sounds, but the large bell is somewhat louder with more of an echo and extended ring. In Harmony Hall, the Large Bell can be found in the left-hand room, in a corner with the other percussion Instruments.",

        "text": "The Hairtousle Teen is found in the Underground Caverns in Hidden Forest, at the entrance from the Elevated Clearing, near the butterfly jars. This Spirit has a standard memory with 6 memory fragments and a 20-minute overall time limit. At the beginning of the memory, players can burn the wax over the jars containing butterflies and perform a Deep Call, which will make the butterflies gather around the player's avatar and lift them up the cliff to a few Light Blooms, which can be used to ascend further. As their memory unfolds, the Hairtousle Teen can be seen playing guitar for the Pleaful Parent, sitting besides them. Suddenly, the Hairtousle Teen walks away with their head and shoulders dropped, while the Pleaful Parent runs after them. The two Spirits makes their way to a room that is only accessible through a gate which the Pleaful Parent cannot get through, as it is closed. The third fragment is located behind a closed gate, which can only be opened by a button from far away. While the gate does close quickly as soon as the player leaves the button, it is possible to pass through alone, by dashing or flying very quickly when the gate has opened all the way. It will be of most help to have a friend open the gate, before the player passes through and collects the fragment, which will keep the gate open for a bit longer so that the friend can also pass through and join the player. Inside, the Hairtousle Teen stands infront of a ukulele. They take the instrument with them and play it alone on a cliff behind the room, without the Pleaful Parent. Eventually, the Hairtousle Teen takes off alone and retreats to a spot high up on a mountain, opposite of their room. To collect the last fragment on top of a high mountain, Jellyfish and Light Blooms can be of help to ascend further and charge the player's wings. At the end of the memory, the Hairtousle Teen plays a melody on their ukulele, while the player grabs a bell from underneath their cape and rings it, causing the Pleaful Parent to appear infront of the Hairtousle Teen.

After burning the Darkness covering the entrance and entering the cave, Deep Calling is recommended to flip the three Dark Crabs guarding the area, preventing them from attacking while you locate the Spirit. As their memory unfolds, the Hide'n'Seek Pioneer is seen beginning a game of Hide and Seek with another Spirit, holding their hands over their eyes as they count down while the other rushes out of the cave to find a hiding spot. The young Spirit then begins to seek out their fellow player, darting about the Forest's Brook in a spirited hunt. At the end of the memory, the Hide'n'Seek Pioneer finally spots the other Spirit peeking around the corner of a pavilion. Still feeling playful, the young Spirit glances both ways behind them in dramatic fashion, as if to request another game of Hide and Seek.",

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 6 memory fragments and a 25-minute overall time limit. During the memory, the Spirit must be carried all the way up the mountain. Certain sections of the path require flying while carrying the Spirit, making this one of the more difficult memories to complete - particularly for players with little Winged Light. The best way to complete this memory is to slowly fly up against the wall while carrying the light - this ensures that the light does not fall down but instead \"climbs up the wall\" with the player. As their memory unfolds, the Hiking Grouch can be seen being lead up the mountain by the Sanctuary Guide. Together, the two Spirits climb the steps winding around the steep peaks to reach the summit - with the Hiking Grouch looking sullen throughout the entire trek. At the end of the memory, the Sanctuary Guide gestures towards the stunning view from the top of the mountain, encouraging their companion to admire the islands' natural beauty. Utterly unimpressed, the Hiking Grouch crosses their arms and turns away, snubbing the Sanctuary Guide's efforts.",

As their memory unfolds, the Hunter spots a pair of Mantas flying nearby and begins to hunt them, carefully sneaking closer with a net in hand. As the Spirit closes in, they start running and launch the net towards the fleeing creatures. At the end of the memory, the Hunter has managed to net one of the Mantas while the other escapes, safe from capture. Pleased by this success, the Hunter stands over their quarry and strikes a pose, proudly flexing both arms."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Jolly Geologist can be seen walking through the cave, collecting luminescent minerals dotted throughout its cavities. Wandering further into the cave, the Spirit spots light coming from an underground water source. Curious, the Jolly Geologist jumps into the water to investigate and swims through a tunnel leading to a large cavern. Awaiting inside is a huge structure of minerals that illuminates the surroundings in a dazzling display of natural beauty. At the end of the memory, the Jolly Geologist cannot contain their joy and does a jaunty victory dance, celebrating their greatest find."

Unlike other collection memory Spirits, the Leaping Dancer does not have any memory fragments featuring some sort of story. During their memory, the player must quickly skate around the center ice rink to gather the star-shaped fragments before the time runs out. The player must then open the two-player door once again to return to the Spirit's statue.

Most of its characteristics are similar to the . The player stands up while playing and clanging on the bell with large arm movements. The Bell plays the percussion part on Music Sheets. As with all percussion Instruments, it only has 8 notes. These notes are a subset (CDGA in C major) of one octave: i.e., the first row notes are C4, D4, G4, and A4 (from left to right); the second row notes have the same pitches (C4, D4, G4, and A4) but a different timbre. These are a subset of the Instrument's lower octave. The notes shift based upon the current key, as with all Instruments, so more generally the Bell's notes correspond to notes 8, 9, 12, and 13 of the Piano. However, to add one extra complication, keys G, A♭, A, B♭ or B are shifted down by one octave -- i.e., in those keys the Bell's notes are notes 1, 2, 5, and 6 in the Piano's lower octave. Note that when playing with other Instruments, other players' notes (the purple notes) are shown based on location, not pitch. So in C major, if a Piano plays G4 (its 5th note), the note that turns purple for the Bell is its 5th note, which is C4 instead of G4. In Harmony Hall, the Small Bell can be found in the left-hand room, in a corner with the other percussion Instruments.",

As their memory unfolds, the Light Whisperer can be seen strolling around the pond as they spot an injured baby Manta. The Spirit hurries to its side and immediately takes the injured creature to a nearby island in a boat pulled by a second, larger Manta. The Light Whisperer urgently carries the Light Creature towards a care station set up on the smaller island, where they tend to the baby Manta. After the Light Whisperer's good care, the baby Manta is able to fly again with help of their caretaker, taking off into the sky as the Spirit watches. At the end of the memory, the Light Whisperer releases the baby Manta into the air, which calls back to the Spirit as it flies away.

This Spirit has a standard memory with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Lively Navigator can be seen boarding a flying boat pulled by a single Manta. They arrive shortly afterwards at the main island and dock the boat to begin walking, following a path that winds around to the other side. The Lively Navigator then grabs a pair of hand-held flags that are laying nearby and begins to work, using marshaling signals with the flags to direct the flow of traffic in the Wind Paths. Sometime later, a flying boat carrying the Talented Builder arrives, with a large flock of Mantas headed directly towards them. Alarmed by the potential collision, the Lively Navigator scrambles to direct the other Spirit out of danger. At the end of the memory, the Talented Builder waves with gratitude towards the Lively Navigator from the boat as they continue on their way without incident. Pleased by the job well done, the Lively Navigator nods back in affirmation.",

The Marching Adventurer spots a stick that looks just right, and continues to carry it throughout the rest of the memory. The Adventurer and the Cadet soon come across a large, fallen log connecting two hills like a bridge.

The Adventurer and the Cadet meet up again towards the end of the memory. At the end of the memory, the Adventurer finds the Cadet on a ledge a little higher up.

Two other young Spirits invite them to join in chasing a Butterfly, but before Melancholy Mope can refuse, one of the Spirits takes their hand and drags them by force towards the Butterflies. The Melancholy Mope remains reluctant to play, wanting to stay behind, but both Spirits take their hands and force them to climb the hill in search of the Butterflies. The Melancholy Mope spots more flowers nearby and quickly loses interest in the chase. As the other two Spirits continue running ahead, the Melancholy Mope quietly turns back to their initial location.

As their memory unfolds, the Mellow Musician and the Frantic Stagehand can be seen carrying a stack of props over towards the Theater. The Frantic Stagehand loads the props onto a sled for easier transport, but the Musician is distracted by something on the other side of the row of buildings. The Musician finds the Twirling Champion and the Cheerful Spectator playing music together on their instruments, and forgets about the task at hand. The Stagehand looks around, confused as to where the Musician went. Eventually, the Stagehand finds the Musician bouncing along to the beat of the music that the Champion and Spectator are playing. At the end of the memory, the Stagehand is seen running over to the Musician, who is bobbing their head along to the song. The Stagehand puts their hands on their hips in response to the sight before them."

Note that the player cannot move around while playing the Instrument, unlike all other Instruments played standing. The icon for this Instrument features a \"fermata\" symbol in its upper left corner. In music notation, this symbol indicates that one can play and hold a note for as long as one wants. The same principle applies to this Guitar, and players are able to hold any note for as long as they want as well. Once the sound of the initial strum fades away, a pleasant hum takes its place for as long as the note is held. The Electric Guitar plays the melody part on Music Sheets. Its pitch is the one octave lower than the standard Instrument (in C major, it covers C3 to C5). In Harmony Hall, the Electric Guitar can be found in the left room with all the other stringed Instruments, in its own niche in the center of the wall.",

This Spirit has a standard memory with 7 memory fragments and a 12-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Bird Whisperer can be seen sitting in the gras alongside the Light Whisperer, watching Birds fly by. Suddenly, the Spirits jump to their feet as they spot an injured Bird, separated from the flock, just above their island. The Migrating Bird Whisperer quickly runs towards the Bird and gently catches it. They bring it to the base of the small island, inside the Light Whisperer's workshop, where they carefully placd the Bird on a pillow. After some rest, the Spirits bring the Bird outside and let it fly free, where it is welcomed by their flock. Uplifted by their good deed, the Bird Whisperer frolicks across the field, before they stop and watch the swarm fly away, touched by this wonderful moment. At the end of the memory, the Migrating Bird Whisperer happily runs across the grass before watching the huge swarm of Birds fly across the sky, completely in awe. Touched by this wonderful moment, they place their hands above their heart."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 8 memory fragments and a 13-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer can be seen in the middle of a solo picnic, as a Butterfly flies onto their arm, startling the Spirit. The Butterfly flies off and the Spirit stumbles after them. After a bit of a chase, the Spirit comes across a big swarm of more Butterflies, joined by the one they just followed. Fascinated, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer follows the swarm down the hill, completely in focus. The Spirit attempts to reach the Butterflies by jumping up, but instead they stumble further down the hill, which they eventually tumble down. At the foot of the hill, the Spirit sits on the ground, dizzy from their turbulous journey, but happily surrounded by Butterflies. At the end of the memory, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer sits on the ground while their head turns from dizzyness. They shake it out and stand back up, to surprisingly see an even bigger swarm of Butterflies flying up into the sky near them. Happy about such a special moment, they raise up their arms and take in the scenery."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 9 memory fragments and a 12-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Jelly Whisperer can be seen sneaking up on some Jellyfish. Once they're close, they climb up a ledge and jump into the middle of the unsuspecting Jellyfish flock, which immeditately scurry away, though not very far. The Whisperer watches as the Jellyfish leave, before the trying their luck again as they carefully follow the creatures to their new spot. This time, the Jellyfish spot the Spirit earlier, but as they begin to fly away, the Whisperer reaches out after them. The flock stops and turns around, coming back to the Migrating Jelly Whisperer. At last, their wish is granted as the flock lifts them up in the air, where the Spirit floats and dances amongst their newly found friends. At the end of the memory, the Migrating Jelly Whisperer stands by the Jellyfish, jumping and performing pirouettes in the air. They stop their joyous dance to watch another group of small and big Jellyfish pass by and fly high up into the sky."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Manta Whisperer can be seen conducting a Manta race, with the Backflipping Champion and Proud Victor as contestants, each kneeling on one of the Light Creatures. The Whisperer raises two hand-held flags to signal the Spirits to get ready, but they accidentally fly off early. After panicking a bit, the Whisperer manages to catch up to the Spirits, and continues to signal them to \"set\", and finally, \"go!\". During the race, the Spirits are accompanied by more Mantas that fly alongside them. While the Migrating Manta Whisperer continues to navigate the contestants and Manta herd around the area, the Backflipping Champion leads the race the entire time. But then, shortly before the end, the Proud Victor catches up and flies through the goal post as victor of the race. At the end of the memory, the Migrating Manta Whisperer strikes a pose while navigating the Spirits with the flags. Shortly after, they applaude the Backflipping Champion and Proud Victor, which bow in return. Then, they turns around to see a swarm of Mantas fly across the area, quietly stunning the Spirits with their presence."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Modest Dancer can be seen sneaking behind a row of buildings towards a small clearing. They make sure no one is following them, and once they are alone, they are seen performing different dance moves. Suddenly, the Forgetful Storyteller finds the Modest Dancer and approaches the Dancer to say hello. Startled, the Dancer rushes out of the clearing. The Storyteller follows the Dancer, and takes them by the sleeve to encourage the shy Dancer to continue their routine behind the row of buildings. The two walk back to the clearing, Dancer seeming more reluctant than the Storyteller. The Forgetful Storyteller attempts to get the Dancer to open up, and the two continue the dance routine together. At the end of the memory, the Modest Dancer puts their hands over each other on their lap and shyly sways from left to right in response to Storyteller's request to dance, and the two Spirits dance as a duet."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 11 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Nightbird Whisperer can be seen birdwatching with a notebook in hand, chasing eagerly after their subjects. To better observe a bird landed on the ground, the Spirit hides behind one of the many nearby monoliths. At this point the Jolly Geologist arrives, walking joyfully through the area, and startles the bird into taking flight by coming too close. The Nightbird Whisperer comes out of hiding to invite the Jolly Geologist to join their birdwatching, guiding them towards an alcove to observe from together. At the end of the memory, the Nightbird Whisperer lets out a loud bird's call that echoes through the cave and a bird responds, flying towards the Spirit duo."

(Note: Meditate next to the Passage Stone campfire and turn Isle of Dawn to nightfall in order to see this Spirit.) This Spirit has a standard memory with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Oddball Outcast can be seen playing alone with a small ball, tossing it between their feet like a hacky sack. The Spirit accidentally drops the ball down the nearby hill and runs to chase after it. A little bit further away, three adolescent Spirits are playing with a much larger ball and one wanders over to invite the Oddball Outcast to come join their group. The Spirit declines and so, shrugging, the group of adolescents resume their game. As the group disappears in the distance, the Oddball Outcast finds themself alone once again. At the end of the memory, the Oddball Outcast finally recovers their wayward ball and resumes their game of hacky sack, content to play alone while the group of adolescents leave."

This Spirit has a standard memory with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, two young Spirits can be seen racing each other up a hill, with the Overactive Overachiever watching from a distance. At the end of the race, the victor jumps in the air in celebration of their win. The Overactive Overachiever then steps closer to wave and invite the pair to another race. All three Spirits return to the bottom of the hill to begin the race, with the Overactive Overachiever quickly passing them and taking the lead. At the top of the hill, the two defeated young Spirits rest, winded after their tiring race, while the Overactive Overachiever climbs a bar that is protruding from a tall rock nearby. At the end of the memory, the Overactive Overachiever shows off their boundless energy by performing one-handed pull-ups. The other young Spirits watch on in disbelief, glancing at each other with a defeated expression."

They coincidentally spot the Bearhug Hermit walking in the snow and promptly hide behind a building, peeking at the Spirit. After the Hermit has gone a bit further, the Peeking Postman is greeted by the young Skater, and the two unite in their pursuit of the Bearhug Hermit. They carefully follow the Spirit on their hike up a hill, when the Hermit suddenly turns around and spots their two pursuers, making them jump up in surprise. At the end of the memory, the Bearhug Hermit waves at the young Skater and the Peeking Postman. The Peeking Postman immediately hides under their Cape and takes a few moments before regaining confidence and letting their temporary shelter fall.",

This Spirit has a standard memory with 5 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Pleading Child goes out to play with another taller Spirit, presuembly their friend or guardian, which carries a square-shaped portable table on their back. The two Spirit settle down on the ground and begin playing with their plush toys over the table, the Pleading Child with a Crab plush, and the other Spirit with a Manta one. Suddenly, the accompanying Spirit spots two soldiers from afar, one of which points at the two and the other carrying a big spear in their hands. Quickly they are besides their targets and arrest the older Spirit to take them away, while the Pleading Child tries to go after and beg the soldiers to let the Spirit go, but they have no chance against the big soldier with the spear keeping them from following. At last, the soldiers and the other Spirit are gone, leaving the Pleading Child alone, sobbing besides their destroyed table and the plush toys laying on the ground. At the end of the memory, the Pleading Child puts their palms together and pleads with all their might at the soldiers, but they ignore the little Spirit and leave them behind, making them realize that all their pleading has no effect. Defeated and hopeless, the Pleading Child lets their head fall and covers their face with their hands, crying."

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 5 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. This Spirit memory requires players to make their way through territory patrolled by several Dark Dragons. To complete this memory safely, it is advised to bring at least one friend who can either draw away the Dark Dargons from the player or help collect lost Winged Light if they have been hit. Another strategy could be to learn the Dark Dargons' routes and act accordingly, however, there are certain stretches where the player will be exposed and unprotected for a prolonged time, making it difficult to avoid the Dark Dragons. As their memory unfolds, the Pleaful Parent can be seen chasing their companion Crab through the Graveyard, occasionally hiding from the watchful eyes of the Dark Dragons. When they reach the far side of the area, the Spirit can be seen diving after the Crab and missing. They return back to the bonfire, where the Crab stands on top of the Pleaful Parent's head. At the end of the memory, the companion Crab runs off as the Pleaful Parent puts their hands on their head in shock. The Spirit tries to run after the Crab, but it disappears into the dense green fog. The Pleaful Parent then drops to their knees and extends their left arm, as if they were pleading, \"Don't go!\". The player then comes up behind the Pleaful Parent and rings a small bell; when the Pleaful Parent turns around and is surprised to see the player, the player is prompted to copy (and, thus, learn) the same pleaful expression.",

As their memory unfolds, the Pointing Candlemaker is seen teaching two other Spirits about what candles are, how they are made, and what they are used for. After showing them the second cave Mural that depicts Isle of Dawn and its Elder, the Pointing Candlemaker invites them to a boat waiting outside the cave. At the end of the memory, the two Spirits have boarded the boat filled with jars and candles. The shorter Spirit raises both arms in excitement while the other Spirit claps, and the Pointing Candlemaker points towards their next destination: the Isle Temple.",

As their memory unfolds, the Princess can be seen lounging on a mat at the center of the chamber while Mantas and Birds fly overhead. As the Spirit falls asleep, they begin to dream of the Nine-Colored Deer and of chasing after the spectral creature as it prances gracefully through the air. When the Princess eventually wakes, it's to the sight of the Feudal Lord approaching their resting place. At the end of the memory, the Princess rises from their mat and rushes to greet the Feudal Lord, eager to share the contents of their dream - and of a desire to make it become a reality."

The Prophet of Earth first greets the young Spirits before directing them to a seating area at the center of the Cave of Prophecies. Together, they sit with a larger group of Spirits listening intently to the lessons being provided by all four of the Prophets. The group then splits up as the Prophet of Earth takes their students aside, leading them towards the entrance of the Trial of Earth to continue the lesson. All three Spirits stretch their muscles before starting to climb the steep terrain - only for the clumsiest student to slip and nearly fall before the others could catch them. At the end of the memory, the Prophet of Earth teaches the younger Spirits about resilience by decisively brushing a hand over both shoulders.",

The Prophet of Fire first greets the young Spirits before directing them to a seating area at the center of the Cave of Prophecies. Together, they sit with a larger group of Spirits listening intently to the lessons being provided by all four of the Prophets. The group then splits up as the Prophet of Fire takes their students aside, enthusiastically leading them towards the entrance of the Trial of Fire. The Spirit takes a seat on a rocky ledge to continue the lesson.

The Prophet of Water first greets the young Spirits before directing them to a seating area at the center of the Cave of Prophecies. Together, they sit with a larger group of Spirits listening intently to the lessons being provided by all four of the Prophets. The group then splits up as the Prophet of Water takes their two students aside, leading them towards the entrance of the Trial of Water to continue the lesson. One of the younger Spirits slips and falls into a nearby pool of water during the teaching and the exasperated Prophet of Water helps them get back on their feet. At the end of the memory, the Prophet of Water teaches the younger Spirits about patience by demonstrating how to breathe deeply and relax.",

This Spirit has a standard memory with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Moments Guide and the Reassuring Ranger can be seen climbing the nearby hills. As they ascend, they reach a steep section and the Moments Guide stays behind, completely frozen by fear. The Reassuring Ranger goes back to reassure their companion and together they finally reach their destination. Side by side, they pause to catch their breath, gazing out at the awe-inspiring beauty that unfolds before their eyes. The Prairie Peaks lay below them, a tapestry of vibrant greens and earthen tones. At the end of the memory, the Reassuring Ranger holds the Moments Guide by their shoulders, quietly admiring the beauty of the Prairie Peaks, side by side."

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 4 memory fragements and a 15-minute overall time limit. This Spirit memory can be difficult to complete, as several Dark Dragons roam the area. It is advisable to wait before a Dark Dragon has just passed before advancing to the next memory fragement. Bringing a friend as a precaution can also be of help in case you are attacked by a Dark Dragon, or for luring them away. Another thing to note is to preferably not burn the Dark Plants leading up to the cave containing butterflies, as they can act as a helpful staircase towards the last memory fragement. Alternatively, players can carefully and slowly fly alongside the outer wall, carrying the light with them. As their memory unfolds, the Respectful Pianist can be seen making their way across the Graveyard, ending on a high ledge above the tunnel filled with butterflies and a Darkness Plant in its center. At the end of the memory, the Respectful Pianist puts a hand to their chest and bows their head towards the player in a solemn acknowledgment, as if respecting them for walking into danger to free them.",

        "text": "The Saluting Protector can be found in Golden Wasteland’s Graveyard Entrance, aka First Krill Area, under the collapsed bell structure to the player’s left if they enter from the Broken Temple. This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 6 memory fragments and an unlimited overall time limit. This memory can be difficult to relive due to the Dark Dragon patrolling the small area in a circle. Patience is key to successfully reliving this Spirit memory, and it is encouraged to use the unlimited time limit to the player's advantage. Bringing a few friends along would be a good idea, as they can help recharge the player's Cape and can collect their lost Winged Light if they do get hit by the Dark Dragon. Alternatively, there is a minor bug that can be used to make reliving this Spirit's memory significantly easier, especially for solo players. When re-entering the Spirit's area from any entrance into the Crab Fields, the Dark Dragon defending the First Krill Area will often fail to spawn in, removing the primary threat of the area and greatly speeding up the process of reliving the Spirit's memory. As their memory unfolds, the Saluting Protector can be seen dancing on top of the ruined bell structures to the left, right, and middle sides of the central structure. They continue up the ruins, and continues to dance until they reach a smaller area at the top of the ruins, to the player's left. Finally, they pose at the center of the area at the top of a gently sloped ramp, their feet close together and their hands posed in front of their stomach. At the end of the memory, the Saluting Protector commends the player for making the long trek across the ruins. They raise their left hand to their forehead and quickly move their hand forwards in a dismissive, but respectful, saluting gesture.",

They take the jar back to their little farm, only to realize that birds have started to gather around the seeds. Immediately the Scarecrow Farmer hurries to their seeds and shoos the birds away. At the end of the memory, the Scarecrow Farmer walks by their patch of farmland, only to spot that a flock of birds has gathered around their planted seeds.

As their memory unfolds, the Scaredy Cadet and the Marching Adventurer can be seen working together to build a hammock. They appear to be short of a few pieces, and the Adventurer encourages the Cadet to venture through the Forest's Brook to go find more supplies. The two Spirits walk along the Brook until the Adventurer spots some extra hammock parts on the other side of the water. The Adventurer crosses the Brook with ease, while the Cadet remains on the opposite side, frightened of the water. At the end of the memory, the Marching Adventurer beckons to the Scaredy Cadet, encouraging them to cross the Brook. The Cadet dips one foot into the water, but quickly pulls their foot out and shakes the water off of it.",

With the Spirit traumatized from recent events and unable to move, players complete a series of tasks, helping the Spirit gain back their bravery and defend against instruders. Players can interact with the Scarred Sentry without completing any Quests. However, only if no Quest is active can they be interacted with, which can be done by starting a Quest from the Season of The Two Embers - Part 1, teleporting Home, and then using the Return Shrine to go back to The Last City. Now no Quest will be active and the player can explore the area freely."

Players should be wary of the rain; it is advised to bring a friend to recharge or an umbrella if you have one. As with any spirits under the rain, it will expire if left too long under the rain, so be sure to collect the memory in time before it fades away. As their memory unfolds, the Baffled Botanist can be seen hiding behind the treehouse and looking at the Scolding Student, who seems to be examining different natural things around the threehouse. At the end of the memory the Baffled Botanist can be seen kneeling in front of a lantern with their back to the Student. The Student scolds them but the Botanist stands up, turns around, and gives the light to the Student. The Scolding Student seems moved by the offering.",

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 10 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. In order to complete this Spirit Memory, players will have to carry the light up to the top of a series of platforms, which can pose to be difficult, as there is a high risk the light will fall down between a gap. It will be of help to exhibit patience and let the light touch the next platform before each jump, assuring that it will not fall down. For some higher plaforms, carefully coordinated flying can make it easier to advance. As their memory unfolds, the Shushing Light Scholar can be seen making their way up to each platform, periodically assuming a praying pose throughout their journey. At the top, they once again stand a praying position alongside two other spirits. At the end of the memory, the Shushing Light Scholar shushes the player by bringing their hand up to their mouth.",

Once they're close, they climb up a ledge and jump into the middle of the unsuspecting Jellyfish flock, which immeditately scurry away, though not very far. The Whisperer watches as the Jellyfish leave, before the trying their luck again as they carefully follow the creatures to their new spot. This time, the Jellyfish spot the Spirit earlier, but as they begin to fly away, the Whisperer reaches out after them. The flock stops and turns around, coming back to the Migrating Jelly Whisperer. At last, their wish is granted as the flock lifts them up in the air, where the Spirit floats and dances amongst their newly found friends. At the end of the memory, the Migrating Jelly Whisperer stands by the Jellyfish, jumping and performing pirouettes in the air. They stop their joyous dance to watch another group of small and big Jellyfish pass by and fly high up into the sky. </div>"

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Slouching Soldier recalls several events in their life that lead them to drink dark water in a jar to cope. First, the Slouching Soldier stumbles with their left hand outstretched in front of a group of other Spirits standing on a hill: the Saluting Captain, Backflipping Champion, and Fainting Warrior. The Soldier then stands on that same hill, holding a jar. They walk back down the hill and hunch over their dropped jar. Over on the next hill, the Slouching Soldier runs over to a few Star Lamps as offered by the Star Collector. The Spirit sits where those Star Lamps once were, burying their face into their arm. They stumble along with a jar in hand. Once again, the Soldier flounders towards a scene at the top of the largest hill. At the top, a parental Spirit stands with two scared Spirit children, one in each arm. The Soldier carries another jar. At the end of the memory, the Slouching Soldier flings the empty jar to the ground and drops to their knees and hands. The Little Prince enters the scene and asks, \"Why are you drinking the dark water?\" \"So that I may forget,\" the Soldier replies, without looking up. \"Forget what?\" \"Forget that I am ashamed.\" \"Ashamed of what?\" The Slouching Soldier stands up, covers their face, and runs off shouting, \"Ashamed of drinking the dark water!\" The Little Prince watches on as the Soldier grabs another jar and contemplates aloud, \"Grown-ups are certainly very, very odd.\" The jar is tossed aside and the Soldier slouches in despair.",

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Sneezing Geographer can be seen studying illustrations of the stars, clouds, and the mountain on which the Eye of Eden rests. They look out in the sky and wander from book to book, deep in thought. The Spirit then climbs up a flight of stairs to gaze at the open pages of a book as big as themself, which shows an illustration of the Little Prince, speaking with another Spirit, and each of the Spirits of the Season of The Little Prince, as well as the Seasonal Guide, The Rose, on the Prince's home planet. At the end of the memory, the Geographer sneezes before continuing to pore over the book. The Little Prince approaches the Geographer, says hello, and asks, \"What are you reading?\" The Geographer then admonishes the Prince. \"Don't interrupt please. I'm studying a visitor from another planet.\" The Prince scratches his head in confusion, as the illustration in the book depicts him, the \"visitor from another planet\", and mentions that \"Grown-ups sure are interesting.\"",

As their memory unfolds, the Snoozing Carpenter can be seen reading an instruction manual on how to build the cloth coverings seen across the Ark. The Spirit then gets to work building more tent-like coverings, and works down the length of the Ark until they get closer to the bow of the ship. Once they reach the front end of the ship, they lean against a large stone vase for support. At the end of the memory, the Snoozing Carpenter looks out across the Ark, seeing all the work they have done. They turn around afterwards and prop themself up against the large vase, nodding off as they do.",

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 10 memory fragments and a 20-minute overall time limit. If the player has not relived at least one Regular Spirit from Golden Wasteland yet, they can also enter through the Maze's exit, which is not blocked by any barrier. The Maze's exit is also located at the player's left when entering the Temple, but higher up on the third section from left to right. To relive the Sparkler Parent's memory, players will journey through the dark Maze. To help see more clearly through the darkness, players can bring out their candle from the Menu, or activate a Glow Spell. At several points throughout the memory, it is required to drop down a level, which can best be done by carefully dropping or flying down a wall or edge while pulling the light with them. Crabs can also be found in some areas, which can be stunned by letting out a Deep Call. As their memory unfolds, the Sparkler Parent can be seen making their way through the maze while holding a lantern to light the way. Having reached their destination in a small room with several boxes, pots, and decorative candles, they pick up a box with small fireworks, candles, and sparklers in it. Outside of the maze, they showcase some sparklers to the Boogie Kid and Confetti Cousin, who each have their hands brought together and lean forward in awe. At the end of the memory, the Sparkler Parent lights sparklers and waves them through the air, before the Boogie Kid and Confetti Cousin repeat the same. The player then grabs a bell from underneath their cape and rings it, causing the Sparkler Parent to stop. They bring their hand to their chin and think for a short while, before they raise up their arm in epiphany, with a glowing exclamation mark blinking above their head.",

As their memory unfolds, the Spinning Mentor, who can be seen seen sitting on the perimeter of the ice rink, is approached by the young Skater. The Mentor proceeds to guide the Skater through various techniques they will need to use on the ice. The Mentor advises the Skater to keep their knees bent, and helps work them through the steps needed to perform a spin. When the Skater falls, the Mentor helps them up, and the two are also seen skating together. At the end of the memory, the young Skater seems to have fallen and is sprawled across the ice. The Spinning Mentor beckons for the young student to rise, and the Mentor proceeds to give a demonstration of the spin that the Skater is trying to master. The Skater, amazed, claps for the Mentor, who politely bows and gestures for the Skater to give it a try. The Skater successfully skates into a spin, and the Mentor nods approvingly.",

From Monday, March 4, 2024 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8) until Sunday, March 10, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7), join Spirits from the Season of Assembly for a short Spring Camping trip in Daylight Prairie above the eight-player door to see them and make a campsite of your own! For the duration of the event, Scaredy Cadet appears in Aviary Village, offering to teleport players directly to the campsite. During their week-long camping trip, the Assembly crew will bring a fire that shares Social Light with everyone, as well as a special Shared Spaces Shrine that encompasses the entirety of the area and offers a range of items for everyone to use—including a couple of new Props that could build something a little sturdier than just a tent. Head over with friends or find new ones there, and you might also catch a glimpse of a mysterious creature who sometimes can be spotted in the area, too."

As their memory unfolds, the Star Collector can be seen dashing between the two split halves of the broken boat as stars twinkle merrily in the night sky. At the end of the memory, the Star Collector sits at a desk covered in star lamps and counts the many stars overhead, chuckling to themself with glee at the numbers. The Little Prince then enters the scene and asks the Spirit, \"What do you do with these stars?\" The Star Collector puts their hands on their hips, nodding as they proudly answer, \"I own them. Five-hundred-and-one millions of them.\" \"Why owning the stars?\" The curious Little Prince asks as the Spirit continues to count. \"It makes me rich,\" The Star Collector says. Unsatisfied with their response, the Little Prince questions them once more, \"Why do you want to be rich?\" Chuckling as if the answer was obvious, the Star Collector replies, \"To buy more stars.\" The Little Prince tilts his head and contemplates aloud, \"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary.\"",

This Spirit has a standard memory with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Stretching Lamplighter can be seen stretching before running about the lamp with a long, blue pole in hand, repeatedly turning the light on and off. Eventually they pause to take a break from their tireless work, pole leaning against the wall as the Spirit bends over their knees to catch their breath. At the end of the memory, the Stretching Lamplighter straightens to stretch their arms out forward and then backwards. The Little Prince enters the scene and exclaims, \"You look exhausted! Why do you keep turning the light on?\" The Spirit continues to stretch as they explain, \"I have an order to turn the light on when it is off.\" Head tilting with confusion, the Little Prince asks, \"Then why do you turn it off after turning it on?\" \"I have another order to turn the light off when it is on,\" the Stretching Lamplighter replies. \"Then you are unlucky,\" concludes the Little Prince with a hand to his chin. The Stretching Lamplighter continues to stretch out their sore muscles, unbothered by their endless task. \"Orders are orders.\"",

They are located next to the bottom of a set of stairs on their island. This Spirit has a standard memory with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Talented Builder can be seen hard at work building a boat figurehead in their workshop. Once finished, they cheerfully carry the object over to a Manta-driven boat to travel towards the main island, where they arrive to find another Spirit waiting by a larger boat docked for repairs. The Talented Builder then climbs up onto the boat and affixes the figurehead onto the boat’s bow before presenting their finished work to the other Spirit, which cheerfully throws their arms into the air. At the end of the memory, the Talented Builder steps back from their repairs, dusts off their hands, and gestures towards the boat as they present it to the other Spirit. The Spirit responds by thanking them, clasping their hands gratefully and bowing their head.",

There are four openings in the roof of the cave, in addition to the two ground-level entrances that are blocked by Darkness Plants. This Spirit is a standard memory quest with 5 memory fragments and an unlimited overall time limit. All of the memory fragments are sheltered from the rain. As their memory unfolds, the Tearful Light Miner and three other Spirits are seen trapped within the cave by the Darkness Plants covering the entrances. Several large boulders then collapse and pin down two of the unfortunate Spirits, and the Tearful Light Miner and remaining Spirit desperately attempt to free them from the rubble - to no avail. Some time later, a pair of grave markers made of small stones are stacked in the center of the cave in honor of their memory. The desolate Tearful Light Miner rests with the other surviving Spirit, who has since been engulfed by a Darkness Plant that the player must burn. They do not survive, and the Tearful Light Miner is once again left behind with another addition to the grave markers. At the end of the memory, the Tearful Light Miner remains the sole survivor of the tragedy. Filled with grief over their fallen companions, they cover their face with their hands and weep.",

This Spirit has a carry spirit memory with 7 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall time limit. In order to open the door on the Vault's First Floor, players will first need to unlock the inline_text Expression from the Levitating Adept. Four players are needed to open the gate and once all four are present, interact with the Telekinesis prompt on the stones in front of the door together to unlock the room beyond it. As their memory unfolds, the Thoughtful Director can be seen making their way through the tunnel behind the 4-player door and into the open room beyond it, entering a closed door tucked into the back-left corner. Light the two braziers sitting in front of the door to open it. The Spirit continues to ponderously travel through the winding tunnel and meets the Praying Acolyte kneeling in prayer along the way, who joins their journey onwards. Near the end of the tunnel, the two Spirits meet the Polite Scholar and together, the three Spirits walk the last few steps to the ledge overlooking the open room. At the end of the memory, the Thoughtful Director looks out into the large open room where their memory began, back turned to the player. They bring a hand up to tap at their chin, swaying side to side and lost in their thoughts.",

As their memory unfolds, the Timid Bookworm can be seen sitting on the ground with a book before they spot the Sanctuary Guide a few steps away, which is holding out their hand in the air. They approach the Guide carefully and observe how a butterfly sits on their outstretched hand. The two Spirits then make their way up the floating island, stopping at a floating Jellyfish once, before arriving at the very top, where a big swarm of butterflies flocks around the Sanctuary Guide, while the Timid Bookworm watches in awe a few steps away. At the end of the memory, the Timid Bookworm sits quietly near the Sanctuary Guide, reading a book. The Sanctuary Guide holds out their left palm to allow a butterfly to land, which makes the Timid Bookworm look up from their book and stand up, shyly holding their right arm. The butterfly then flutters away from the Guide and the Timid Bookworm reaches up with both arms to try and catch it, but the little creature has already flown out of their reach. A little embarrassed, the Timid Bookworm shyly holds their right arm.",

When entering from the area's main entrance, let yourself be guided by the wind and fly straight until you arrive at the main island. Your landing point should be at or near the bottom of a set of stone steps near the Flight Guide, at the top of which the Tinkering Chimesmith can be found. This Spirit has a standard memory with 10 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Tinkering Chimesmith can be seen climbing up the stone steps, hanging chimes from each stone arch on their way up the mountain. On the second arch, they drop their hammer while hanging the wind chimes but they continue their work and travel on upwards, where they reach the top of the mountain, which holds a big stone arch. The Spirit pauses at the foot of the stone arch and uses their hands to measure where they want their bells to hang from. Once their work is finally - and successfully - done, the Chimesmith stores their tool on a Manta-driven boat and boards it, before taking off in direction of another, smaller island, not far away. This island, which is positioned at a higher altitude than the Talented Builder's neighboring island, is home to their workshop, where they are seen pondering their work and curling up next to their worktable. After a little rest, the Spirit continues their work by tinkering with the chimes hanging from the pillars supporting their little abode and observing them from below. At the end of the memory, the Tinkering Chimesmith stands beneath the wind chimes hanging in their workshop, which clank and ring against one another, creating a beautiful melody. Lost in thought, the Spirit observes the chimes while enjoying the wonderful sounds.",

This Spirit has a standard memory with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer can be seen standing beside a bed where another Spirit, presumably their loved one, lies in sickness. The Tea-Brewer then puts a kettle on the stove and goes out the door with a basket hanging from their arm. On their way, they come across a few soldiers in front of a fortress with an opening in the wall. The Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer carefully sneaks past it behind their backs. Finally at their destination, they pick a few herbs near a tree and lay them in their basket. On the way back home, they carefully tiptoe past the soldier's gate again. Having arrived at home, they go on to prepare their loved one a tea with the picked herbs, when suddenly they let the kettle fall as they see that the other Spirit lies motionless in bed. The Tea-Brewer immediately rushes to their side, weeping, leaving the kettle shattered to pieces on the ground. At the end of the memory, the Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer peeks out from the opening in the wall behind the soldiers' backs before slowly and quietly tiptoeing their way past them."

From Monday, July 29, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7) through Sunday, August 18, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7), players could join a rotating series of games that had them running, leaping, soaring, and even scampering through some of the best-known places in Sky! For the duration of the event, the Crab of Triumph appeared in Home and Aviary Village, offering to take players directly to a special version of the Coliseum. Each day until the day of the closing ceremony, players could take part in two different games to enjoy some lighthearted and friendly competition with fellow Sky Kids. Complete games to score points for your assigned team and earn event currency—along with some extra Light to reward your efforts. On the final day on August 18, fly to the closing ceremony in the Coliseum to celebrate the winning team under the thunderous roars of the crowds.",

(Note: Meditate next to the Passage Stone campfire and turn Isle of Dawn to nightfall in order to see this Spirit.) This Spirit has a standard memory with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall time limit. As their memory unfolds, the Tumbling Troublemaker can be seen dancing while two other young Spirits are busy collecting stones in a basket. The playful Spirit then juggles two stones while the other two carry their basket onwards across the dunes. Halfway down a small incline, the Tumbling Troublemaker trips and starts rolling alongside the stones they dropped. At the bottom of the slope, the Tumbling Troublemaker and the stones crash into the other two Spirits, knocking them down and causing their basket to go flying. At the end of the memory, the Tumbling Troublemaker raises their head, a little dazed, as the other two Spirits burst into laughter and shake their heads in dismay."

It was a Season Pass exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's fourth node ( total). The player is standing up while playing the Instrument, which plays 15 notes. Its sound is similar to the Flute but the Panflute's sound is deeper and echoes more. The Panflute plays the wind part on Music Sheets. Its pitch is the same as the standard Instrument (in C Major, it covers C4 to C6). In Harmony Hall, the Panflute can be found on the back wall, behind and to the right of the front counter in an alcove above the Horn.",

As their memory unfolds, the Ushering Stargazer is seen traveling across the land together with another Spirit. The Ushering Stargazer spots a falling star streaking across the sky and rushes ahead while their friend lags behind. What lands is not a star but a small child - curled up and unconscious. Concerned, the Ushering Stargazer urges their slow companion to hurry up and come closer. At the end of the memory, the two Spirits stand over the fallen child who begins to stir. The Ushering Stargazer and their friend give each other an uncertain glance, wondering what to do with their discovery.",

As their memory unfolds, the Wounded Warrior can be seen at the war with another soldier. Their first battle is triumphant and they celebrate by waving their spears in the air and doing high fives. Along the way, they stop at a merchant. While the Wounded Warrior is selecting a potted plant to take home, they are attacked by two other enemies. Spears send pots flying everywhere, also killing the merchant instantly. The last scene shows the Wounded Warrior looking at the innocent deceased merchant, while the other compatriot encourages them to leave the scene. At the end of the memory, we can see a scene closer to the Wounded Warrior, kneeling and wounded, watching the disaster they have just witnessed, the death of an innocent, caught in the wrong place, at the wrong moment."
