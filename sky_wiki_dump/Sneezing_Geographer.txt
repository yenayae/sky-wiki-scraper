== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|zR55gSf77vs||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Sneezing Geographer can be found in the [[Starlight Desert]], on top of the giant pile of books floating in the clouds at the far end of the area, relative to the [[Vault of Knowledge]]'s entrance. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Sneezing Geographer can be seen studying illustrations of the stars, clouds, and the mountain on which the [[Eye of Eden]] rests. They look out in the sky and wander from book to book, deep in thought. The Spirit then climbs up a flight of stairs to gaze at the open pages of a book as big as themself, which shows an illustration of the Little Prince, speaking with another Spirit, and each of the Spirits of the [[Season of The Little Prince]], as well as the Seasonal Guide, [[The Rose]], on the Prince's home planet.

At the end of the memory, the Geographer sneezes before continuing to pore over the book. 

The Little Prince approaches the Geographer, says hello, and asks, "What are you reading?"

The Geographer then admonishes the Prince. "Don't interrupt please. I'm studying a visitor from another planet."

The Prince scratches his head in confusion, as the illustration in the book depicts him, the "visitor from another planet", and mentions that "Grown-ups sure are interesting."<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar hold their hands to their chest and lean back quickly further and further with their eyes closing as they prepare to sneeze, before sneezing once. During the sneeze, their arms fly up to the sides and their Cape lifts up, before they stand still and finally wipe across their face with their right arm. Three high-pitched notes play while your avatar leans back, and finally, a fourth, louder eighth note plays as they sneeze, ended with a quieter note as they wipe their face.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a bunch of round, green light particles bursting out from your avatar's face as they sneeze, which quickly turn yellow, then orange, and finally a red color as they fall to the ground.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean far back and cover their face with their left hand to prepare to sneeze, before pausing briefly. Right after, they will sneeze so heavily that they jump up in the air with their feet spread wide apart and their arms lifted straight to the sides, before landing again and shaking out their head. A similar 3-note procession will play, but the fourth note that can be heard as your avatar sneezes is a much louder triplet note.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a trail of glowing, golden light particles following the motion of your avatar's hands as they prepare to sneeze, and a bunch of round, green light particles bursting out from their face as they sneeze, which quickly turn yellow, then orange, and finally a red color as they fall to the ground.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
