The Frightened Refugee can be found on an elevated platform near a pit of [[Dark Crabs]], partway through [[Broken Temple]]. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Frightened Refuge runs across the wreckage of the platform, fleeing from an unseen danger and taking shelter within the crooked building nearby.

At the end of the memory, the Frightened Refuge glances nervously at their surroundings. Suddenly, the entire building shakes with a loud rumbling noise, causing the Spirit to duck down in terror.<br>
