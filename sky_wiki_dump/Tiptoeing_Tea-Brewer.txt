==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|Bn-OBKVySX8||inline|Video Guide}}

The Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer can be found in the [[Repository of Refuge]], in an opening in the wall of the balcony high up on the player's left when entering the area. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
As their memory unfolds, the Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer can be seen standing beside a bed where another Spirit, presumably their loved one, lies in sickness. The Tea-Brewer then puts a kettle on the stove and goes out the door with a basket hanging from their arm. On their way, they come across a few soldiers in front of a fortress with an opening in the wall. The Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer carefully sneaks past it behind their backs. Finally at their destination, they pick a few herbs near a tree and lay them in their basket. On the way back home, they carefully tiptoe past the soldier's gate again. Having arrived at home, they go on to prepare their loved one a tea with the picked herbs, when suddenly they let the kettle fall as they see that the other Spirit lies motionless in bed. The Tea-Brewer immediately rushes to their side, weeping, leaving the kettle shattered to pieces on the ground.

At the end of the memory, the Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer peeks out from the opening in the wall behind the soldiers' backs before slowly and quietly tiptoeing their way past them.

*Level 1 will make your avatar slightly crouch down with their arms lifted at their sides and look around periodically with squinted eyes. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be canceled by jumping or flying up once. When moved, your avatar will carefully and slowly walk forward step by step, with their body leaned backwards, while singular xylophone notes play in rhythm with each step.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with trails of small sparkles following the path of your avatar's feet, as well as a glowing ring appearing at the foot that steps forward each time they take a step. 
*Level 3 will make your avatar hunch their back and bring their loose hands close together near their face, while looking around periodically with squinted eyes. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be canceled by jumping or flying up once. When moved, your avatar will tiptoe in small, quick steps, while high-pitched xylophone notes play in rhythm with each step.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a trail of golden, glowing sparkles following your path on the ground and flying up as they fade away.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
