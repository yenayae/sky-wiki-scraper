<section begin="Summary" />
The Abyss Monster or Many-Eyed Monster (named "'''Monster'''" in beta updates), fan-nicknamed "'''Rosie'''," '''Leviathan,''' and '''Megalodon''' by beta testers and "'''King Krill"''' by live players is found exclusively in the depths of [[Treasure Reef]]. It appears as a larger and more intimidating type of [[Dark Dragons|krill creature]], with its many red glowing eyes and a pair of horn.<section end="Summary" />

Its first appearance can be witnessed with the release of the [[Season of Abyss#Quest #4|4th quest]] during [[Season of Abyss]] in update [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/866-patch-notes---january-13-2022---0-16-0-182597/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZEN9KdRLBW25DqPkRRNR0kwT_NVLwccyg9_xz4bm95hmbrn7YP_HNDmsI_aem_IKI76_V9es148w0KJsELjA 0.16.0]. While no harm can be done to players venturing out of bounds after the 4th quest, it devours the player and the [[Cackling Cannoneer]] Spirit in the [[Season of Abyss#Quest #5|5th quest]] that was released in update [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/885-hotfix--march-4-2022---0-16-5-186434-android/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZEN9KdRLBW25DqPkRRNR0kwT_NVLwccyg9_xz4bm95hmbrn7YP_HNDmsI_aem_IKI76_V9es148w0KJsELjA 0.16.5]. After a scene where you help a [[Mantas|manta]] from inside the Monster, the Monster spits out the player and the Cackling Cannoneer, along with a variety of [[fishes]]. Upon completion of the Abyss quests, you can safely visit the Many-Eyed Monster by going to its previous location in the 5th quest, at the bottom of the Abyss.

In update [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/952-patch-notes---october-13-2022---0-19-0-202986-android-huawei-ios-202613-switch/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZEN9KdRLBW25DqPkRRNR0kwT_NVLwccyg9_xz4bm95hmbrn7YP_HNDmsI_aem_IKI76_V9es148w0KJsELjA 0.19.0], Sky introduced [[Map Shrines]]. In the Treasure Reef map, the Monster is visible towering next to the big tower.

During Season of Moomin, the Monster appeared during the [[Moominvalley|4th Storybook Quest]] in update [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/1356-patch-notes---october-10-2024---0-27-0-294170-android-huawei-292054-ios-playstation-steam-switch/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZEN9KdRLBW25DqPkRRNR0kwT_NVLwccyg9_xz4bm95hmbrn7YP_HNDmsI_aem_IKI76_V9es148w0KJsELjA 0.27.0], where the Monster nearly eats the player as they pass by. Even if you try to intentionally get eaten by the Monster, you'll just pass through the in game model instead, and nothing happens. In the [[Moominvalley|6th Storybook Quest]], the Monster attempts to eat the player, but the player then destroys it as they fly through the Monster.

In [[Days of Nature|Days of Nature 2025]] introduced in update [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/1391-patch-notes---april-17-2025---0-29-0-319554-android-huawei-ios-playstation-steam-switch/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZEN9KdRLBW25DqPkRRNR0kwT_NVLwccyg9_xz4bm95hmbrn7YP_HNDmsI_aem_IKI76_V9es148w0KJsELjA 0.29.0], the Monster can be seen afar polluting the waters of [[Sanctuary Islands]]. No interaction between the Monster and the player was made when the event ran. The Monster is also inaccessible by normal means, as it's blocked by a wind wall.

== Change History ==
After update 0.16.5, one of the 5th Abyss quest cutscenes (the one where the Monster eats you and the Cackling Cannoneer) got changed multiple times alongside the Monster's in game model, as seen by the PS4 Launch Trailer for Sky.

In update 0.29.0, the Monster's in game model is unknowingly broken (the one where it's visible from afar in Treasure Reef) alongside with the [[Whales|Whale]]. In the same update, the opening cutscene for when you visit the Monster at the bottom of the Abyss has also been changed to look more polished.
