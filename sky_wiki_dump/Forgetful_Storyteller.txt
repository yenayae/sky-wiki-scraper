== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|lCphLOCgLWA||inline|Video Guide}}

The Forgetful Storyteller can be found in the [[Village Theater]], on the ledge just above the right entrance to the backstage area if facing the stage from within the audience. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 10 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Forgetful Storyteller can be seen meeting with the [[Modest Dancer]] on a nearby bench. The two talk together on the bench, and a mask and a book are propped up against the bench next to the Storyteller. The Storyteller soon has to say goodbye, and begins to walk away before the Modest Dancer calls them over since they had forgotten the extra mask they brought. The Forgetful Storyteller thanks them and continues towards the stage. Modest Dancer then realizes that Storyteller forgot their book as well, and is seen chasing after the Storyteller to return it to them. The Forgetful Storyteller turns to the Dancer as they present the forgotten book, thankful for the Dancer's help.

At the end of the memory, the Dancer returns the book with a flourish, and the Forgetful Storyteller presses their palms agains their cheek in an adoring "Awww" expression.

*Level 1 will make your avatar press both palms together and place their clasped hands on their left cheek, rocking from side to side as if admiring something, while a slow xylophone riff sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a bunch of red hearts quickly flying up behind your avatar.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean forward to rest their head in their hands, gently shaking their head, while a quick xylophone riff sound effect plays. At the end of the Expression, your avatar will put their hands on their knees and tilt their head to the left as the xylophone riff comes to a close.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a trail of small pink hearts following the movement of your avatar's hands, as well as a bunch of red hearts flying up during the first half of the Expression, and a big pink heart flickering above their head during the second half.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
