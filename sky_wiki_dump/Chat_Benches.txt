<section begin="Summary" />'''Chat Benches''' are interactive features present throughout the kingdom of Sky that allow players to sit and talk to any player who sits next to them, regardless of friendship status. Most Chat Benches require a lit Candle to be interacted with, but a few of them can be utilized without any special requirement. Chat Benches that require a lit Candle have a limited period of activation, as it burns out after five minutes. Once the Candle burns out, a player needs to offer a new one to reactivate it.

Some Chat Benches in Seasonal areas are only accessible after completing certain Quests offered by Seasonal Guides.<section begin="Summary" />
