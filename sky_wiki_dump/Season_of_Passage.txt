The '''Season of Passage''' was the seventeenth Seasonal Event in the Live version of ''Sky'' since the global release, following [[Season of Remembrance]]. It began  '''April 17, 2023 at 00:00 PDT (UTC -7)''' and ended '''23:59 July 2, 2023 at 23:59 PDT (UTC -7)''',<ref name="passage-extended">The Season's end date had been extended from June 25 to July 2, probably as a response to the frequent crashing that iOS players experienced in Patch {{v|0.21.5}}.</ref> lasting '''77''' days. 

Venture into the twilight and meet four young Spirits in [[Isle of Dawn]]. Experience their memories as each one learned to navigate the route towards their community.<br>

==Child of Light Locations<span id="Winged Light Locations"></span>==
No [[Children of Light]] were added to the Season of Passage.

==Spirit Memory Quests==
The Season of Passage featured a new Quest format featuring [[Festival Tech]]. In addition, each Seasonal Quest brings players to different areas throughout the Realms at night, giving a fresh perspective to old locations.

All the Quests can be completed independently but, starting with the [[#Quest 2|second Quest]] onwards, they are held with larger groups of Sky Kids, with each player’s effort contributing to the greater goal (and opportunities to earn a bit of extra [[Pieces of Light|Light]] along the way). 

These larger group Quests begin at set intervals, several times per hour ('''every 15 minutes''' at '''xx:00''', '''xx:15''', '''xx:30''', '''xx:45'''), to allow initiates to participate together. Head to the location where the Quests begin ahead of time and gather with your group during the countdown to each ritual. If you meditate to join the Quest outside of the start time, you’ll be in the Quest area "waiting room" during the countdown until it eventually starts.    

Players not in the same server with you will look different during the Quests, taking the shape of fluffy white creatures wearing Masks, as pictured below.<br>

===Quest #1<span id="Quest 1"></span>===
In the first Quest, the [[Passage Guide]] seeks your help as the unruly adolescent [[#Spirits and Cosmetics|Spirits]] are late to prepare the landscape for the evening Passages. The Passage Guide summons the first sacred Mask in [[Isle of Dawn]], above the cave containing a [[Children_of_Light#Isle_of_Dawn_(9)|Child of Light]], for you to find and complete the preparations on their behalf.

Initiate the lessons of Passage by sitting at the meditation spot that appears after lighting the Mask. Five tiny fire cauldrons will float above your head that must be delivered to specific locations across the sand dunes. (''Honking will reveal a blue star that indicates their locations.'') You will be prompted to use the {{Emote|Stretching Guru|inline_text}} [[Expression]] to place down the cauldron, each of which must then be lit. Once all five have been placed and lit, the Quest is completed. The particles of light originating from the cauldrons are drawn towards the [[Passage Stone]], swirling around it in a mesmerizing nighttime display reminiscent of thousands of fireflies. 

Next, speak to the Passage Guide at the Passage Stone, where the reluctant adolescent Spirits have been summoned by the cauldrons' flames. The Passage Guide recalls the sacred Mask with the appearance of a '''Bear''' and mounts it on the side of the Passage Stone, where four empty markings suggest more Quests to come. Below it, a [[Murals|Mural]] is added that depicts the summoning of the four young Spirits.

With the completion of this Quest, [[Festival Tech]] is permanently activated for the Passage Stone, allowing players to explore the desert at nightfall alongside a crowd.<br>

===Quest #2<span id="Quest 2"></span>===
[[File:Wax-forest-brook-passage-reliance.png|thumb|249x249px|Passage of Reliance Mask location]]
In the second Quest, the [[Passage Guide]] has crafted a Mask to teach the '''Passage of Reliance'''. The Passage Guide summons the second sacred Mask in [[Forest's Brook]], at the base of a tree near the entrance from [[Forest Clearing]], and sends you along with the adolescent Spirits to find and complete its Passage.

Initiate the Passage of Reliance by sitting at the meditation spot that appears after lighting the Mask. Once the Quest begins at its [[#Spirit Memory Quests|set intervals]] of every 15 minutes, you are instructed to clean up debris that careless prospectors have discarded throughout Forest's Brook. "The darkness of the forest will overcome you if you wander too far," so make sure to stay within the safety of the Mask's light as it moves through the forest. Picking up the debris along the path will reward you with [[Pieces of Light]], some of which require the help of other players to collect - however, only a single piece of debris is needed to complete the Quest. 

Once finished, speak to the Passage Guide at the [[Passage Stone]], where the Spirits have climbed on top to gather after having honored the wisdom of Reliance. The Passage Guide recalls the sacred Mask with the appearance of a '''Serow''' and mounts it on the side of the Passage Stone, next to the previous one. Below it, a [[Murals|Mural]] is added that depicts the trek through the littered forest. With the completion of this Quest, the [[Overactive Overachiever]] will now wear the [[Passage Guide#Serow Mask|Serow Mask]] while resting at the Passage Stone and during subsequent cutscenes.<br>
<br>
{{#ev:youtube|xLNv6QYTvP4|300px||Quest 2 by Nastymold}}

===Quest #3<span id="Quest 3"></span>===
[[File:Wax-prairie-caves-passage-assistance.png|thumb|249x249px|Passage of Assistance Mask location]]
In the third Quest, the [[Passage Guide]] has crafted a Mask to teach the '''Passage of Assistance'''. The Passage Guide summons the third sacred Mask in [[Prairie Caves]], at the strip of land between the two ponds within its center, and sends you along with the adolescent Spirits to find and complete its Passage.

Initiate the Passage of Assistance by sitting at the meditation spot that appears after lighting the Mask. Once the Quest begins at its [[#Spirit Memory Quests|set intervals]] of every 15 minutes, you are instructed to group up with others to gather as many masks as you can before they spin away. To collect the sparkling blue masks that appear throughout the area, you must stand near one for several seconds while your avatar automatically uses the {{Emote|Levitating Adept|inline_text}} [[Expression]]. The speed at which they are collected will increase with the number of players standing near the mask, and each one that is gathered will reward you with [[Pieces of Light]] - however, only a single mask is needed to complete the Quest. When the timer runs out and the Quest ends, the swirling orb of masks at the center of Prairie Caves will explode and leave behind even more Light for the player to collect.

Once finished, speak to the Passage Guide at the [[Passage Stone]], where the Spirits have climbed on top to gather after having honored the wisdom of Assistance. The Passage Guide recalls the sacred Mask with the appearance of a '''Boar''' and mounts it on the side of the Passage Stone, next to the previous two. Below it, a [[Murals|Mural]] is added that depicts the chase within the eclipsed cave. With the completion of this Quest, the [[Melancholy Mope]] will now wear the [[Passage Guide#Boar Mask|Boar Mask]] while resting at the Passage Stone and during subsequent cutscenes.<br>
<br>
{{#ev:youtube|nKb4ZlBLLYE|300px||Quest 3 by Nastymold}}

===Quest #4<span id="Quest 4"></span>===
[[File:Wax-prairie-butterfly-fields-passage-coordination.png|thumb|249x249px|Passage of Coordination Mask location]]
In the fourth Quest, the [[Passage Guide]] has crafted a Mask to teach the '''Passage of Coordination'''. The Passage Guide summons the fourth sacred Mask in [[Butterfly Fields]], on the side of the cave hiding a [[Children_of_Light#Butterfly_Fields_(3)|Child of Light]], and sends you along with the adolescent Spirits to find and complete its Passage.

Initiate the Passage of Coordination by sitting at the meditation spot that appears after lighting the Mask. Once the Quest begins at its [[#Spirit Memory Quests|set intervals]] of every 15 minutes, you are instructed to push the lights to awaken the dormant masks around the fields. Your avatar will automatically use the {{Emote|Levitating Adept|inline_text}} [[Expression]] when you stand near a large yellow orb and push it away. The closer to the center of the orb you stand, the faster it will be pushed. Each mask that is awakened by pushing a light orb into it will reward you with [[Pieces of Light]], with the paired masks rewarding larger quantities - however, only a single mask needs to be awakened to complete the Quest.

Once finished, speak to the Passage Guide at the [[Passage Stone]], where the Spirits have climbed on top to gather after having honored the wisdom of Coordination. The Passage Guide recalls the sacred Mask with the appearance of a '''Monkey''' and mounts it on the side of the Passage Stone, next to the previous three. Below it, a [[Murals|Mural]] is added that depicts the awakening of the masks within the fields.

The Passage Guide stands back to admire the Murals with three of their pupils before the [[Tumbling Troublemaker]] rolls into the scene - and crashes right into their teacher's legs. Unimpressed with their antics, the Passage Guide sends the young Spirit away. With the completion of this Quest, the [[Oddball Outcast]] will now wear the [[Passage Guide#Monkey Mask|Monkey Mask]] while resting at the Passage Stone and during subsequent cutscenes.<br>
<br>
{{#ev:youtube|aXshB3wWGZ0|300px||Quest 4 by Nastymold}}

===Quest #5<span id="Quest 5"></span>===
[[File:Wax-forest-tree-tunnels-passage-alignment.png|thumb|249x249px|Passage of Alignment Mask location]]
In the fifth and final Quest, the [[Passage Guide]] has crafted a Mask to teach the '''Passage of Alignment'''. The Passage Guide summons the fifth sacred Mask in [[Tree Tunnels]], at the base of a tree near the entrance from [[Forest's Brook]], and sends you along with the adolescent Spirits to find and complete its Passage.

Initiate the Passage of Alignment by sitting at the meditation spot that appears after lighting the Mask. Once the Quest begins at its [[#Spirit Memory Quests|set intervals]] of every 15 minutes, you are instructed to reestablish the Light Stream's path through the forest flora. Your avatar will automatically use the {{Emote|Stretching Guru|inline_text}} [[Expression]] when you are near the blue Light Stream, and in order to guide its path forward, you must coordinate with other players to form a line towards the fire cauldrons along the path. (''Honking will reveal a blue star that indicates their locations.'') The speed at which the Light Stream moves will increase with the number of players lined up, and each fire cauldron that is reached will reward you with [[Pieces of Light]] - however, only a single cauldron is needed to complete the Quest.

Once finished, speak to the Passage Guide at the [[Passage Stone]], where the Spirits have climbed on top to gather after having honored the wisdom of Alignment, and the [[Tumbling Troublemaker]]'s mischief has been forgiven. The Passage Guide recalls the sacred Mask with the appearance of a '''Racoon''' and mounts it on the side of the Passage Stone, next to the previous four. Below it, a [[Murals|Mural]] is added that depicts the procession through the forest. With all the Passages completed, the five sacred Masks rearrange themselves to form a circle, and additional details are added to the Mural. Lastly, the Tumbling Troublemaker will wear the [[Passage Guide#Raccoon Mask|Raccoon Mask]] during the final cutscene where the Spirits offer their thanks and a final farewell.<br>
