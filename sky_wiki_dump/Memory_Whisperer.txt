The Memory Whisperer can be found on a floating island on the [[Fourth Floor Vault|Fourth Floor of Vault]], at the small [[Mantas|Manta]] skeleton surrounded by Red Candles. This Spirit does not have a conventional memory quest; there is no kneeling figure that needs to be lit up.

Instead, the Spirit is triggered once the circle of Red Candles are lit. Players who have previously unlocked the {{Emote|Manta Call|inline_text}} can then interact with the icon that appears to summon a baby Cosmic Manta and be granted the [[#Call|Cosmic Manta Call]].<br>

== <span id="Expression">Call</span> ==
The Memory Whisperer does not offer an [[Expression]], but instead offers a [[Call]]. The {{Emote||inline_text}} modifies the player's voice to a mellow honk.

''Unlocking the {{Emote|Manta Call|inline_text}} from [[Manta Whisperer]] is a prerequisite to learning this Call.''<br>
