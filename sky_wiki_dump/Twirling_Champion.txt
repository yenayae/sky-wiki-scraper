The Twirling Champion can be found on the left side of the [[Ice Rink|Valley of Triumph's Ice Rink]], near the rock wall that surrounds the area. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 6-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Twirling Champion can be seen performing a series of complicated leaps and twirls all around the rink, repeatedly launching themself several feet into the air. After the impressive display ends, the [[Confident Sightseer]] and the [[Leaping Dancer]] are seen standing side-by-side with the Twirling Champion as all three Spirits wave to unseen onlookers and celebrate their skill.

At the end of the memory, the Twirling Champion performs one last move, hopping into a simple twirl.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar hop into a small twirl that finishes with their arms extended and their left leg swept out to the side while a short percussion accent plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a white ray of light and sparkles following the avatar's hands.
*Level 3 will make your avatar leap into a higher, faster twirl with more revolutions, finishing with their arms extended and their left leg swept even further out to the side while a longer, ascending percussion accent plays.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with a white ray of light following the avatar's hands and a burst of white light particles coming from the feet as they hit the ground.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

In [[Harmony Hall]], the Panflute can be found on the back wall, behind and to the right of the front counter in an alcove above the [[Horn]].<br>
