==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|Kam3kuo2UPU||inline|Video Guide}}

The Light Whisperer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on the bottom left side of the main island when facing it from the area's main entrance, next to a pond, with a waterfall above. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Light Whisperer can be seen strolling around the pond as they spot an injured baby [[Mantas|Manta]]. The Spirit hurries to its side and immediately takes the injured creature to a nearby island in a boat pulled by a second, larger Manta. The Light Whisperer urgently carries the Light Creature towards a care station set up on the smaller island, where they tend to the baby Manta. After the Light Whisperer's good care, the baby Manta is able to fly again with help of their caretaker, taking off into the sky as the Spirit watches.

At the end of the memory, the Light Whisperer releases the baby Manta into the air, which calls back to the Spirit as it flies away. The Light Whisperer returns the farewell call and watches as the creature flies off.<br>
