|-
| colspan=4| '''How to Apply:''' 1. Place the patch onto the desired area of a garment - pre-heat iron to 350F. Press the iron on top of the patch for 5 seconds and then on top of the fabric under the patch for 25 seconds. Set aside to cool and set.<br>2. Recommended step: place a light-colored cloth on top of the patch when pressing to prevent damage to the patch.<br>3. Sew a few stitches around the edge of the patch after ironing to strengthen the bond.<br>4. The iron-on method is recommended for cotton/linen fabric. Sew on the patches for sweaters/faux leather/lace garments instead.<br>*Please follow the instructions for application, and be careful of the iron's high temperature.
