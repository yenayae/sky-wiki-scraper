<section begin="Summary" />'''The Musicians' Legacy''' is a [[Ancestors#Seasonal Entities|Seasonal Shop]] from the [[Season of Duets]]. The Musicians' Legacy is found in the [[Concert Hall]] in [[Aviary Village]], within the curtained hallway behind the stage after completing the [[Season of Duets#Quest #1|first Seasonal Quest]]. Unlike typical [[Seasonal Spirits]], there is no need to first relive a [[Spirit Memories|spirit memory]] to access this Shop and it does not offer an [[Expression]]. The collectibles offered by this Shop are the {{Spirit Item|The Musicians' Legacy|Instrument_c|inline_text|label=Cello Instrument|link=The Musicians' Legacy#Cello}}, the {{Spirit Item|The Musicians' Legacy|Instrument_p|inline_text|label=Grand Piano Instrument|link=The Musicians' Legacy#Grand Piano}}, and the {{Music Sheet|40|inline_text}}.<section end="Summary" />

==Cosmetics==
===<span id="Instrument">Instruments</span>===
This Seasonal Shop offers a total of two [[Instruments]]: the [[#Cello|Cello]] and the [[#Grand Piano|Grand Piano]].

====<span id="Basic Cello">Cello</span>====
::''Not to be confused with the {{Spirit Item|Compassionate Cellist|instrument|inline_text|label=Duo Cello}}'' (Cellist's purple Cello)
The [[Instrument]] offered by this Shop is the '''Cello'''. It has a blue body with gold accents and four strings. It was offered to all players for {{Cost|34 SC|season=Duets}} during the Season, from the Friendship Tree's third node ({{Cost|72 SC|season=Duets}} total). The player is standing while playing the Instrument, which plays 15 notes. 
<!--

The [[Instrument]] offered by this Shop is the '''Grand Piano'''. It is light gray with blue accents and features the {{Season Icon|Duets|inline_text}} emblem above the keyboard. Unlike most other Instruments, this item also functions as a placeable [[Prop]] that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]]. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node ({{Cost|38 SC|season=Duets}} total). The player must place down the item and sit on the bench to begin playing the Instrument, which plays 15 notes.
