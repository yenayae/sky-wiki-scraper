<div>{{#ev:youtube|rlMGDjpznZo|200px|inline|Video Guide}}

The Laidback Pioneer can be found on the right side of [[Forest's Brook]], inside a hollow tree downhill from the bonfire. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 4 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

In order to successfully carry the light to each fragment through the polluted rain, players can use trees as cover, letting the light recharge in safety before advancing further.

As their memory unfolds, the Laidback Pioneer can be seen taking a hike through the rain with their umbrella to the campfire on the higher elevation. After each collected fragment, a big flower spawns in its place.

At the end of the memory, the Laidback Pioneer sits down to relax by the campfire, while two other spirits are standing at the side, chatting.<br>
