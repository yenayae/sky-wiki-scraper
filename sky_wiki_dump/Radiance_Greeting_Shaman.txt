*Level 1 will make your avatar tilt their head sideways and hold up their hands beside it in a heart shape, before moving them in front of their chest in the same gesture while a small red heart appears inside them.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a thin trail of light following the hands' motion, a small red heart appearing inside the hand shape throughout the entire Expression and multiple small red hearts flying up from the hands during the first half of the Expression.
*Level 3 will make your avatar raise their hand before their face and draw a big heart-half with each hand in the air, which becomes visible by the pink trail following the hands' motion.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with an additional thin trail of light following the hands' motion and a smaller, pink flickering heart appearing in the center of the drawn one.

<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
