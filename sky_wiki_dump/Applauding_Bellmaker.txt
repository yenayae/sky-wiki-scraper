<br>
The Applauding Bellmaker can be found in [[Prairie Villages]] on the left-hand island, in a cave behind a two-player door that also houses a [[Children_of_Light#Villages_(3)|Child of Light]]. This is likely to be the first multi-person door encountered by new players. To open it, two players must each hold their [[Flame]] to one of the flame icons on the door. If you are alone, you can request help from another player by [[Deep Call|Deep Calling]] or explore the rest of the area while you wait for others to appear. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 5 memory fragments<ref>Memory fragment count provided by {{Userlinks|FeatheredFlight}}.</ref> and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Applauding Bellmaker is seen carrying a large bell with the help of another Spirit. Together, they make their way out of the cave and up the hill, pausing to take a rest partway through the climb. Continuing onward, the Spirits reach the bell tower at the peak of the island.

At the end of the memory, the Applauding Bellmaker's companion climbs the bell tower to install the new bell. Now working once again, the bell begins to spin and ring out, causing the Applauding Bellmaker to clap in congratulation of a job well done.<br>
