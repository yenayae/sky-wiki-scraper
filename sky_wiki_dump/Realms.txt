== [[Aviary Village]] ==
[[File:Aviary Village Main.png|300px|thumb|alt=|left]]
Aviary Village brought a new portal to [[Home]] leading to a new area that first appeared with the beginning of [[Season of Revival]]. Through the Season of Revival's Quests, the village grows and develops to become a fully functioning village. Upon completing the [[Season of Revival#Quest #4|fourth Quest]] from the [[Season of Revival]], players can use a special white candle to set Aviary Village as their 'Home' instead of the previous home space mentioned above. After the Season of Revival, some new players start their journey in Aviary Village instead of Home.

Aviary Village is based around the tower once present in the [[Sky: Light Awaits]] version of the game and functions as a larger and more interactive Home space.

See the [[Aviary Village]] page for more information.

[[File:Forest Thumbnail.png|300px|thumb|alt=|left]]
Hidden Forest is the third Realm along your journey, and here is the first time you may encounter creatures or environmental factors that can harm you. Rain can drain your cape energy and cause your light to go out, and Dark Crabs can knock you down and potentially cause you to lose Winged Light. While the route through Hidden Forest is fairly straightforward, there are hidden areas that are slightly off the beaten path.

This realm is based on the concept of teenage years, and its original name was Rain.

== [[Valley of Triumph]] ==

Both races end in the same Coliseum, beyond which is the Temple where you will meet the Valley Elders and be able to move on to the next Realm.

== [[Eye of Eden]] ==
[[File:Eden Social Space.png|300px|thumb|alt=|left]]
Eye of Eden is the final realm you will encounter. It contains Dark Dragons, Dark Crabs, strong winds and waves of flying rocks. All of these have detrimental effects, and may cause the player to lose Winged Light, or be forced back to the start of the stage they are attempting to complete. This realm is based on the concept of death, and the only outcome of Eden is to deposit as much Winged Light as you can and die. This is the main way to obtain Ascended Candles, which can be used to buy Wing Buffs. After dying, the player is reborn along with any Wing Buffs they purchased, allowing them to get a higher cape level. Eden is also where you may purchase the Hair of the Elders.

Eye of Eden's original name was Storm. See the [[Eye of Eden]] page for more.
