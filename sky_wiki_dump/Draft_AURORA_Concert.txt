==Description==
<section begin="Summary"/>The '''AURORA Concert''' (also referred to as '''The Musical Voyage''') is a special event that first occurred '''December 8, 2022 at 20:30 PST (UTC-8)''' and lasted approximately '''50''' minutes. Utilising the [[Festival Tech]] feature, ''Sky'' delivered a revolutionary musical journey where players can feel the wave of emotions from thousands of other players on the same screen, at the same time. 

The AURORA Concert then repeated every 4 hours starting at '''midnight 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' through to '''January 2, 2023'''.<section end="Summary"/>

The AURORA Concert curently repeats every 2 hours<ref>On December 2024, in celebration of the second anniversary of the AURORA concert, TGC [https://x.com/thatskygame/status/1864429573355504006 changed] the in-game schedule for concerts from four hours to two hours. </ref> starting at '''midnight 00:00 PST (UTC-8)'''

For the occasion, the [[Coliseum]] received numerous transformations throughout the Season of AURORA, resulting in the stage turning into a nighttime scene. 

After the last Quest of the [[Season of AURORA]], players were invited to "reserve" their seat in the Coliseum and attend the event at the announced date and time.

Players had the ability to chat with players in the same group or row and new {{icon|Festival-tech-emote-Ray.png|inline}} [[Expression]] emojis were available at the bottom of the screen for the duration of the event: {{icon|FT-light.png|inline}} Waving Light, {{icon|FT-Heart.png|inline}} Heart, {{icon|FT-happy.png|inline}} Happy, and {{icon|FT-sad.png|inline}} Cry.

==Limited Cosmetics==
Once the Concert finished, new [[Premium Candle Shop|IAP]] cosmetics were available for players to purchase from the Mannequin Shop that appears in the Coliseum after completing the [[Season of AURORA#Quest #1|first Quest]]. Free trial Spells of these collaboration IAPs (excluding the [[#Wings of AURORA|Wings of AURORA]]) were available to collect from the Sleepy Traveler's boat at the Coliseum. All Seasonal IAPs offered for the AURORA collaboration were available until the Season ended '''January 2, 2023 at 02:00 PST (UTC-8)'''.

==Seating Arrangements==

Each seat has a unique number and once you have chosen your seat, you are automatically teleported to that seat upon entering the Coliseum.

4176 seats are available but the number of attendees is unlimited. Of the seats available, 4 rows of them (rows 519-522) are VIP seats, only usable when the white candles behind the seats are lit up. These are located in front of the two Prop-filled side rooms and are shaped like sofas.

==The Introduction==
{{#ev:youtube|lzUg5ffOyOo|400|right|The full AURORA Concert||start=57}}
At '''00:00''', the Concert starts with the crowd cheering and clapping. The atmosphere is full of excitement and the camera pans around the Coliseum to show many ghost figures; all players attending the Concert. Then, the AURORA Guide, enveloped in a colorful sphere, glides across the Coliseum and onto center Stage.

A large memory sphere expands and covers the entire Coliseum.

==First Performance: Exhale Inhale==

The players are then individually teleported to a new void area and standing on a rock surrounded by dark water. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-1-Area.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

Glowing particles merge, forming a light and it begins to sing "Exhale Inhale" by AURORA, pulsating with each note. (See Lyrics)

A black tree grows from the water. The light lands on the tree and purple particles emerge from the tree, like leaves. Then when the leaves fall off, the light transforms into a glowing bird and flies to perch on a rock.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-1-Tree.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

Mantas jump out of the water in the background. The light exits the shell of its bird form, which gets consumed by an emerging darkness plant. Briefly transforming into a manta, the light abandons its shell, which turns into a manta-shaped darkness plant.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-1-Manta.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

A large flock of birds converge at the light. The light ascends and turns the sky green and with a flash of lightning, AURORA appears in a green outfit under the rain. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-1-Green-Rain.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

As AURORA slowly raises her hands, the light exits her body and flies towards the player, bursting into blue specks of light. Five Ancestor spirits suddenly appear behind you, standing around you in a circle. They all ascend and the large rock under you rises from the water and above the clouds.

A flock of birds surrounds the light. As the camera zooms out, everything looks out of focus and it is revealed that we were inside the colorful sphere. The scene fades to black.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-1-End.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

===Intermission 1===
AURORA emerges from her colorful sphere and as the crowd cheers, she gracefully floats down onto the stage. She is wearing a small blue butterfly cape and the Runaway Outfit.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-1-Stage.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA: 
*"Hello Friends! I'm so happy to be here with you!"
*"Look at you! We are all here together!"
*"Let's all call to each other!"

Players are invited to honk loudly all together.

*"Oh, how pretty you are!"
*"I see you!"
*"The natural world is our guiding light. Let's follow it now…"

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-1-Sphere.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA welcomes the Running Wayfarer, who walks onto the stage from the Temple. They kneel and present a dark but sparkly sphere with their hands. AURORA activates the sphere and it expands to cover the entire Coliseum.

==Second Performance: Runaway==

Players are collectively transported to a deep blue underwater cavern, swimming around as colorful knifefish.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-2-Area.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

Glowing particles merge to form a light and the song "Runaway" by AURORA starts. (See Lyrics)

! Runaway Lyrics
|-
| <small>
I was listening to the ocean<br>
I saw a face in the sand<br>
But when I picked it up<br>
Then it vanished away from my hands<br>
I had a dream I was seven<br>
Climbing my way in a tree<br>
I saw a piece of heaven<br>
Waiting, impatient, for me<br>
<br>
And I was running far away<br>
Would I run off the world someday?<br>
Nobody knows, nobody knows<br>
And I was dancing in the rain<br>
I felt alive and I can't complain<br>
<br>
But now take me home<br>
Take me home where I belong<br>
I can't take it anymore<br>
<br>
I was painting a picture<br>
The picture was a painting of you<br>
And for a moment I thought you were here<br>
But then again, it wasn't true<br>
And all this time I have been lying<br>
Oh, lying in secret to myself<br>
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf, La-di-da!<br>
<br>
And I was running far away<br>
Would I run off the world someday?<br>
Nobody knows, nobody knows<br>
And I was dancing in the rain<br>
I felt alive and I can't complain<br>
<br>
But now take me home<br>
Take me home where I belong<br>
I got no other place to go<br>
Now take me home<br>
Take me home where I belong<br>
I got no other place to go<br>
Now take me home<br>
Take me home where I belong<br>
I can't take it anymore<br>
<br>
But I kept running for a soft place to fall<br>
And I kept running for a soft place to fall<br>
And I kept running for a soft place to fall<br>
And I kept running for a soft place to fall<br>
<br>
And I was running far away<br>
Would I run off the world someday?<br>
<br>
But now take me home<br>
Take me home where I belong<br>
I got no other place to go<br>
Now take me home<br>
Take me home where I belong<br>
I got no other place to go<br>
<br>
Now take me home, home where I belong<br>
Now take me home, home where I belong<br>
Now take me home, home where I belong<br>
Now take me home, home where I belong<br>
I can't take it anymore</small>

A school of triangular angelfish appears and groups together to propel the light out of the water, into a rainy night. The light explodes into sparkles. Players, now butterflies, follow the light gliding across the surface of water with mantas alongside us, jumping in and out of the water and splashing.

The light finally reaches land after a brief flight through the clouds. A queue of spirits guided by birds are walking towards what looks like a past vision of the Isle of Dawn– a once flourishing land, full of vegetation.

<gallery widths=300px>

The spirits climb the main rock formation with the light waiting at its extremity. A small kid, the first to reach the top, extends their hand towards the light. All the spirits are now kneeling or praying to the light.

The light bursts again into a shower of sparkles and many boats appear, rescuing the group to take them home where they belong. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-2-Boats.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

A single bird (you) flies over the boats, past the Isle Elder standing in the doorway of the Temple, into the clouds leading to Prairie. The other players all join you as birds, looking at the mountain in the distance. The scene fades to black.

===Intermission 2===
We return to the Coliseum, with AURORA now dressed in the green outfit, with the crowd clapping their hands. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-2-Stage.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA: 
*"It gives me hope to see the world so connected." 
*"You have beautiful voices - can you all harmonize with the same call?" 

Players are once more invited to honk loudly all together.

The Orbit credit song "Constellation" by AURORA and Vincent Diamante starts to play. 

*"I'm so happy to be here with you."
*"It's ok, you can cry."
Players are now invited to use the Cry emote.
*"We must take care of each other. We are stronger together."

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-2-Sphere.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA welcomes the Mindful Miner, who walks onto the stage from the Temple. They kneel and present a dark but sparkly sphere with their hands. AURORA activates the sphere and it expands to cover the entire Coliseum.

==Third Performance: All is Soft Inside ==

Players are collectively transported to the Underground Cavern in Forest, floating as colorful jellyfish.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-3-Area.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

A light emerges from the darkness and the song "All is Soft Inside" by AURORA starts. (See Lyrics)

You need to know<br>

Don't let me change<br>
Don't let me go<br>

All around is stone<br>
All is soft inside<br>

All that I know<br>
Lies within emotion<br>
Words remain unspoken<br>
Lead me through the dark<br>
All that I see<br>
Came to me in colours<br>
Lasted for a moment<br>
Leads me through the dark<br>
All that I know<br>

I need it all<br>
I don't know where to begin<br>
I carry more than you see<br>
My dreams are bigger than me<br>
Please bring me light<br>
I bear a shadow<br>
I call them back to me<br>
So they could feed me<br>

All is stone<br>
And all is soft inside<br>

Lies within emotion<br>
Words remain unspoken<br>

What is pure<br>
If the hearts can collide<br>
All that I've ever known<br>
Is the universe is wild<br>

The light wanders around the cave, circling around looking for an exit. Logs block the only pathway out and the light crashes into the blocked passage to emerge into the large hollow Underground Cavern. All the jellyfish follow. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-3-Logs.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

The cave is full of minerals and we are shown the memories of miners collecting them. Memories of jellyfish flee from the excavation.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-3-Miners.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

The light makes its way across the cave. We see a worker falling off a cliff while their teammates helplessly look over the edge, while a jellyfish positions itself under the falling worker, saving them a certain fate.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-3-Falling.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

The light then ascends the central, tallest rock structure in the cave, revealing more minerals and jellyfish all the way up. At the summit, the three spirit miners seem to be expressing their gratitude to the surrounding jellyfish.

The scene fades to white and then back to black. Players are now flying through the clouds of the purple sky in the Starlight Desert. Along the way up, large Royal jellyfish join and float amongst players. As we look to the round full moon, the scene fades to black.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-3-End.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]
===Intermission 3===
We return to the Coliseum, with AURORA now dressed in the orange dress, with the crowd clapping their hands and a bright glowing sphere illuminates AURORA from behind. The ground floor of the Coliseum is flooded with water.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-3-Stage.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA: 
*"Creatures of light are so beautiful!" 

The camera pans back and two Mantas fly around in the Coliseum over the crowd.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-3-Mantas.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA:
*"Call to them when they fly near!" 
*"Look at that!"
*"Hehehe… Yes!" 

*"And remember, you are all warriors of light." 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-3-Sphere.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA welcomes the Warrior of Love, who walks onto the stage from the Temple. They kneel and present a dark but sparkly sphere with their hands. AURORA activates the sphere and it expands to cover the entire Coliseum.

==Fourth Performance: Warrior ==

Players are collectively transported to a new area where they are flying as mantas towards an island covered in clouds and the Eden mountain can be seen afar. Underneath, the once flat ocean surface becomes interrupted by the mounds of snow and large rock formations. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-4-Area.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

As the song "Warrior" by AURORA starts (see lyrics), players are led into a tunnel of clouds alongside some spirit mantas and emerge to the other side where spirit boats use cannons to launch nets to capture mantas.

Flying through the clouds, players witness the unfortunate events surrounding the capture of many mantas by the spirits. Boats head towards the ruins carrying nets full of mantas.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-4-Nets.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

Cages with mantas are piling up on the walls of the ruins along the way. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-4-Cages.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

A flock of mantas free the imprisoned mantas by breaking the cages and they all fly free to freedom with the players to the vast horizon. The camera zooms out to show the intense light beam emitted from the Eden mountain with the freed mantas flying towards it and a Whale jump out of the clouds. The scene fades to black.

===Intermission 4===
We return to the Coliseum, with AURORA now dressed in the green outfit with the crowd clapping their hands. The huge sphere is now higher behind AURORA, but cycles between glowing red, white, and blue.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-4-Stage.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA:
*"That was so liberating!" 
*"Chant with me to build our strength". 
Players are once more invited to honk loudly all together.
*"Thank you all very much!"
*"Thank you so much for all the love!"

AURORA now starts to send the Coliseum emotes to the crowd, one by one.

*"Even if we lose hope, we cannot let our light fade away." 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Inter-4-Sphere.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

AURORA welcomes the Seed of Hope, who walks onto the stage from the Temple. They kneel and present a dark but sparkly sphere with their hands. AURORA activates the sphere and it expands to cover the entire Coliseum.

==Fifth Performance: The Seed ==

Players are collectively transported in the clouds as birds once again. The hallway of clouds leads to a wide open space. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-5-Area.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

A light emerges from the clouds and the song "The Seed" by AURORA starts. (See Lyrics)

! The Seed Lyrics
|-
| <small>
Just like the seed<br>
I don't know where to go<br>
Through dirt and shadow I grow<br>
I'm reaching light through the struggle<br>
Just like the seed<br>
I'm chasing the wonder<br>
I unravel myself<br>
All in slow motion<br>
<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
When the last tree has fallen<br>
And the rivers are poisoned<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
When the last tree has fallen<br>
And the rivers are poisoned<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no, oh, no<br>
<br>
Suffocate me<br>
So my tears can be rain<br>
I will water the ground where I stand<br>
So the flowers can grow back again<br>
Cause just like the seed<br>
Everything wants to live<br>
We are burning our fingers<br>
But we learn and forget<br>
<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
When the last tree has fallen<br>
And the rivers are poisoned<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
When the last tree has fallen<br>
And the rivers are poisoned<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no, oh, no<br>
<br>
Feed me sunlight, feed me air<br>
Feed me truth and feed me prayer<br>
Feed me sunlight, feed me air <br>
Feed me truth and feed me prayers<br>
<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
When the last tree has fallen<br>
And the rivers are poisoned<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no<br>
When the last tree has fallen<br>
And the rivers are poisoned<br>
You cannot eat money, oh no, oh, no</small>

The light begins to emit lightning. The white clouds give way to dark clouds in a large cyclone. A meteor shower begins to fall from the sky in the form of cyan streaks of light into the cyclone. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-5-Lightning.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

Players that approach the eye of the storm where the light is hovering are struck by meteors, removing their light, turning them black, and causing them to fall. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-5-Cyclone.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

A red beam is then emitted from the center of the cyclone.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-5-Beam.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

The clouds turn white once more and the meteors stop. However, it is not long before the meteor shower starts back up again. The light emits electricity and the bird-players are now sucked into the cyclone and propelled into the green polluted air of the Battlefield in the Golden Wasteland. The light slowly descends through the cyclone as streams of meteors scatter across the land.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-5-Meteors.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

Falling to the ground, players transform into butterflies and find themselves in the bowels of a massacre between spirits and even some mantas. The bright cyan streaks of the meteors continue to strike the ground, exploding. As we move forward towards the Temple, more bodies pile up as more spears and shields collide.

At the end, the camera zooms to the top of the stairs where one lonely soul is kneeling with their sword stuck in the ground in front of them, surrounded by the dead. The scene fades to black.

===No Intermission=== 

==Sixth Performance: Through the Eyes of a Child==

The players are then individually teleported to the desolated battlefield after the massacre.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-6-Area.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

A butterfly emerges from the darkness and the song "Through the Eyes of a Child" by AURORA starts. (See Lyrics)

! Through the Eyes of a Child Lyrics
|-
| <small>
World is covered by our trace<br>
Scars we cover up with paint<br>
Watch them preaching sour lies<br>
I would rather see this world through the eyes of a child<br>
Through the eyes of a child<br>
<br>
Darker times will come and go<br>
Times you need to see her smile<br>
And mothers' hards are warm and mild<br>
I would rather feel this world through the skin of a child<br>
Through the skin of a child<br>
<br>
When a human strokes your skin<br>
That is when you let them in<br>
Let them in before they go<br>
I would rather feel alive with a childlike soul<br>
With a childlike soul</small>

As the lone butterfly, players fly over moments of suffering and grief, frozen in time after the end of the war. We pass by a statue of two survivors kneeling and crying over a fallen spirit. Stone statues of other fallen spirits are partially buried in the sand and in the water. Then, we flutter past statues of a survivor carrying the dead in their arms, another kneeling over a dead manta, and a child curled up alone.

At the end of the battlefield, another butterfly joins and together they dance above the dark waters, reflecting the light of a moon. Butterflies chirping each other, emitting growing particles. The particles merge into the light once again. Two mantas circle around the light which causes all players, in the shape of butterflies, to be reunited again. 

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-6-Dance.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

The swarm is drawn to what appears to be a sunrise. As players move forward, a giant glowing yellow spirit with golden wings, in the shape of AURORA gets on her feet and slowly turns around. AURORA, opens her arms and transforms all butterflies into Sky Kids, comforting all the players after the tragedy they just witnessed.

All the players follow AURORA into the sky, under the warm glow of the sun through the clouds.

===No Intermission=== 

==Orbit ==

Now in a blue dress, the giant AURORA and all players fly towards Orbit in the starry space, flying with all the Spirits of Sky and other Light Creatures. "The Light Beyond" by AURORA and Vincent Diamante can be heard in the background. When we reach the end of Orbit, the scene fades to white.

==Last Performance: Queendom== 

The camera pans to show the Eden mountain and the outside of the Coliseum. Then the camera focuses on all the glowing sketches added to the walls of the Coliseum.

The light descending slowly from the sky into the Coliseum. AURORA’s large spirit reappears flying over the crowd and the song "Queendom" by AURORA starts. (See Lyrics)

The underdogs are my lions<br>
The silent ones are my choir<br>
The women will be my soldiers<br>
With the weight of life on their shoulders<br>
<br>
Drink until you’ve had enough<br>
I'll drink from your hands<br>
I will be your warrior<br>
I will be your lamb<br>
<br>
Till queendom come<br>
Till queendom come<br>
My queendom come<br>
My queendom come<br>

The sea waves are my evening gown<br>
And the sun on my head is my crown<br>
I made this queendom on my own<br>
And all the mountains are my throne<br>
<br>
Drink until you've had enough<br>
I'll drink from your hands<br>
I will be your warrior<br>
I will be your lamb<br>

Till queendom come<br>
Till queendom come<br>
My queendom come<br>
My queendom come<br>

My queendom come<br>
My queendom come<br>
<br>
I hunt the grounds for empathy<br>
And hate the way it hides from me<br>
With care and thirst I have become<br>
You have a home in my queendom<br>
You have a home in my queendom<br>
You have a place in my queendom<br>
You have a home..<br>

Players can now stand up from their seats and gather around AURORA. The Coliseum bustles with energy as the spotlights are shining about and the space is filled with mantas, royal jellyfish, birds, and butterflies.

At different instances of the song, players are pulled towards AURORA and then thrown across the Coliseum like rainbow confetti.

At the end of the song, the camera zooms out to show the whole Coliseum and Eden mountain in the background. AURORA’s giant spirit floats above the Coliseum and can be seen surrounded by all the Sky Kids.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Song-7-End.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

==Final Screen== 

AURORA: 
"Always remember, our lights shine brighter together…"

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Quote.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

The final screen shows you how many players shared the AURORA concert experience with you.

You experienced this Musical Voyage alongside ### others like you.

[[File:AURORA-Concert-Final-Screen.png|thumb|300x300px|none]]

==Post-concert Activities==
[[File:AURORA-post-concert-sound-bath.png|thumb|350px|AURORA inside the sound bath after the concert]]
After the concert, all pre-concert activities are still available to players, with the exception that the Bonfires and Campfire Snack Kits are missing. On top of these, players can also find AURORA inside the sound bath after the concert. AURORA is seen in the form of sparkles, idly standing and swinging her arms. She will offer a hug when a player approach her, and speaks after the hug: "Thank you so much for the love! You are so beautiful. And remember to give some of that love to yourself too." Players can hug her multiple times, but she will not repeat her dialogues.

Player can leave the Coliseum by sitting on a meditating spot on the stage to return to Home, or enter either Valley Temple or Village of Dreams via the normal entrances. When attempting to leave, a prompt asking if the player want to "Leave AURORA's Musical Voyage?" appears, with the reminder "You will be able to return while the voyage is still underway." 

If a player chooses to stay in the Coliseum after the concert, the sky will turn from night to day at 15 minutes after end of concert, and the game will force the player to return to Home with a fade-to-white screen at 45 minutes after end of concert.

==Trivia==

* The creatures and colors of mural patterns around the seating areas roughly corresponds to the realms where the season quests take place: 
** Cyan fish: Isle of Dawn
** Blue jellyfish: Hidden Forest
** Red mantas: Valley of Triumph
** Green crabs: Golden Wasteland
* During New Year, AURORA starts the first intermission of concert by saying "Happy New Year!" and "I LOVE this time of year!" before inviting players to call to each other.
* The concert repeats more frequently at every 2 hours during the last day of the season.
