There are several '''Creatures''' that appear throughout the world of ''Sky'', both helpful and harmful. Depending on where they are located, creatures can aid the player in reaching distant areas and places that are complicated to reach alone. Most creatures can be separated into four categories: [[#Light Creatures|Light]], [[#Dark Creatures|Dark]], [[#Neutral|Neutral]], and [[#Misc|Miscellaneous]].<br>
<br>

==Light Creatures==
'''Light Creatures''' are harmless to Sky Kids, are a part of the scenery or cutscenes, can restore a Sky Kid's Light, or can help in memories and quests.

Light Creatures have many forms and shapes, ranging from a small butterfly to a huge whale. They can fly, glide, swim, or walk.<br>

==Dark Creatures==
'''Dark Creatures''' are entities that consumes anything of Light. Running into Dark Creatures will cause you to lose wing energy or stars.  

Sky is not a violent game and Dark Creatures are only symbols of fear and doubt for players. When a player is hit repeatedly, it is possible to lose [[Winged Light]] and thus Cape Wedges. Although you cannot die in Sky, losing wings will remove your ability to fly, making it harder to reach certain areas and forcing you to retrieve lost [[Children of Light]] in all the Realms.  

Dark Creatures also have many forms and shapes, ranging from small crabs to a giant abysmal Monster, but they all share their dark color palettes. They can fly, glide, roam, or swim and are found in all the Realms.<br>
