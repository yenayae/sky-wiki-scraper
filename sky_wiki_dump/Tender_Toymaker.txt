The [[Tender Toymaker]] can be found at the Marketplace in [[The Last City]], between some stalls on the left side (after completing [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1#Quest #1|Quest #1]]). Before that, they can be found resting under a tent, across from the player's starting point in the area, though they cannot be interacted with. 

Unlike other Spirits, the Tender Toymaker has no memory that can be relived, but rather a Seasonal Quest dedicated to them. Showcasing the life of the weary Spirit, struggling to make a day as a Toymaker merchant, this Quest gives players a series of tasks, helping the Spirit get back into the active Marketplace as a merchant.  

Players can interact with the Tender Toymaker upon completion of the [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1#Quest #1|First Quest]].

==Cosmetics==
===<span id="Outfit">Outfit</span>===
The [[Outfit]] offered by this Spirit consists of four layers: a green, long-sleeved dress, an outer dark green dress covered with a green shoulder mantle, and a beige apron tied around the waist.

It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's third node ({{Cost|44 SC|season=Two Embers - Part 1}} total).<br><br>

====Crab Figurine====
The [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a wooden carved [[Dark Crabs|Crab]] toy, partially colored yellow with white accents. It has four stick legs, large, moon-shaped claws, and a star ornament on the forehead. It is a placeable Prop that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]]. This item is purely cosmetic and does not offer any functionality. When carried on its owner's back, it appears in its original form. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's first node ({{Cost|8 SC|season=Two Embers - Part 1}} total).<br><br>

====Manatee Toy====
The [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a wooden carved [[Manatee]] toy, painted with white and yellow. Its tail and fins are tied to the body with string. When equipped, the toy can be interacted with by clicking its {{Spirit Item|Tender Toymaker|prop_m|icon}} icon at the bottom of the screen‚Äîthe avatar will hold it up in front of them, move it in a wave motion and shake its tail, which triggers the fins to be moved as well. It cannot be placed and therefore cannot be used in [[Shared Spaces]]. When carried on its owner's back, it appears in its original form. It was available to all players during the Season from the Friendship Tree's second node ({{Cost|22 SC|season=Two Embers - Part 1}} total).<br><br>
