*Level 1 will make your avatar cough thrice, during which they raise their fist in front of their face, while high squeaking sounds play. Then they will knock on their chest a few times and shake out their head, while bongo sound effects play. 
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a cloud of steam coming from the avatar's face as they cough.
*Level 3 will make your avatar cough hard thrice as they hold one arm across their body, while high-pitched sound effects play. With each cough they slouch more forward - once they've stopped, they'll hold the other hand on their head before slowly standing up straight again.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with clouds of steam coming from the avatar's face as they cough, and glowing orange circles quickly rippling outwards from their head.

Level 1 and 2 can be unlocked in the Blue Bird Guide's [[#Quest Tree|Quest Tree]] after completing the [[Season of the Blue Bird#Quest #1|first Quest]] - Level 1 is free and Level 2 costs 3 {{Cost|Heart}}.
