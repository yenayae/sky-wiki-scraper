The '''Elder of the Vault''' (also known as '''Vault Elder''') can be found at the [[Summit Vault|Summit]] of the [[Vault of Knowledge]]. Relive the Elder's memory to activate all the Spirits that you previously found in the [[Vault of Knowledge]] and open the way to [[Eye of Eden]].

{{#ev:youtube|XOPpzw2g8lY||inline|Vault Elder Cutscene}}
The kneeling Elder with the octahedron looks up towards the child (you). They make beckoning gesture and the child approaches with flame in hand. The Elder picks up the octahedron and brings it up to their face with their eyes closed briefly. They hold out the octahedron to the child and nod, signaling for the child to do the same. The child complies and the flame enters the octahedron. The Elder hands the child the dimly glowing octahedron. Looking up, the child releases the octahedron as it floats up into the darkness.

Against the starry background, the camera pans down towards an dim octahedron. It fills up with light. Each of the realm's constellations radiate out and transform into beautiful murals, depicting each Elder's story. 

After the final Vault constellation mural is revealed, all the Elders appear standing in line (from left to right: Forest, Wasteland, Vault, Prairie, Isle, and Valley). The Vault Elder lowers their arms and the murals fade away behind them.

One at a time, all of them but the Vault Elder slowly kneel before you. The camera pans up towards a constellation in the shape of a crown. It transforms into a kneeling royal holding a floating orb in front of a castle and pillars.
