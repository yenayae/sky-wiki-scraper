==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|euxd4kP-Keo||inline|Video Guide}}

The Talented Builder can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on the lower of a pair of floating islands to the right of the main island when coming from the area's main entrance. They are located next to the bottom of a set of stairs on their island. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Talented Builder can be seen hard at work building a boat figurehead in their workshop. Once finished, they cheerfully carry the object over to a [[Mantas|Manta]]-driven boat to travel towards the main island, where they arrive to find another Spirit waiting by a larger boat docked for repairs. The Talented Builder then climbs up onto the boat and affixes the figurehead onto the boat‚Äôs bow before presenting their finished work to the other Spirit, which cheerfully throws their arms into the air.

At the end of the memory, the Talented Builder steps back from their repairs, dusts off their hands, and gestures towards the boat as they present it to the other Spirit. The Spirit responds by thanking them, clasping their hands gratefully and bowing their head.<br>

* Level 1 will make your avatar brush off their hands a few times before raising both arms to gesture towards the right, head periodically tilting to the side and forward, while a strumming sound effect plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with lots of dust clouds flying around your avatar as they brush off their hands, golden glowing sparkles shortly bursting from their hands as they move their arms to the right, and a few white starburst effects briefly flying around their hands after they've stopped moving their arms.
* Level 3 will make your avatar briefly look around to face the left, before kneeling down on one knee and first opening both arms up, then bringing  them closer together up and in front of them, head periodically tilting to the side and forward and arms moving closer together and away again, while an extended strumming sound effect plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
* Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with small, golden, glowing sparkles bursting from your avatar's hands as they go to kneel down, a sudden burst of big white light particles coming from their hands after they've just knelt down and open up their arms, and the same sparkles as in the beginning of the Expression flying around their hands once, after they've stopped moving around.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
