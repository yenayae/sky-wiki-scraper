The '''Season of Assembly''' began on April 5, 2021 and ended on June 13, 2021, lasting 70 days. It was the ninth Seasonal Event in the Live version of Sky since the Global Release, preceded by the [[Season of Dreams]] and succeeded by the [[Season of The Little Prince]].

The Season of Assembly was set in the [[Hidden Forest]]. It followed a group of children as they seek to build a treehouse together. This was the first season to take place entirely in the Hidden Forest, as well the first season to reintroduce six seasonal spirits since [[Season of Sanctuary]].

==Welcome==
<center class="title-text-welcome">[https://www.thatskygame.com/news/teaser-season-of-assembly Welcome to the Season of Assembly!]</center>
{{Quote|<br/>'''''Be prepared to pledge allegiance as a Scout'''''}}
Set in the rainy Hidden Forest, this story follows a lone Scout spirit who invites players to help build and then adorn a treehouse fit for hosting friends.  Throughout the course of the season, players will be prompted to visit the dwellings of the six other Scout spirits in order to gather the perfect items for improving the space. Each spirit this season is individually related to the realm Ancestors of Sky – with their theme and items a reflection of their personalities.
==The Treehouse==
{{Quote|<br>'''''A secret hideaway in the making.'''''|The Treehouse Opening}}
This season introduced a new area called [[The Treehouse]], located in the [[Hidden Forest]]. There are many entrances you can take to get to this area, including:
*A tunnel on the right as you fly in from the Social Space (requires 1 [[Valley of Triumph]] spirit).
*A tunnel by the treehouse in the Forest clearing, to the left just before the entrance to the river (requires First Seasonal Quest to be done).
*A tunnel inside the treehouse in the Forest's brook (requires Second Seasonal Quest to be done).
*A tunnel by the treehouse by the Boneyard (requires Third Seasonal Quest to be done).
{{Quote|<br>'''''A home away from home.'''''|Restored Treehouse Opening}}Once the Treehouse is fully restored, there'll be furniture, a firepit, hammocks, a spotlight, hoops to fly through, and awnings to protect against the rain. The Shared Space shrine will become active and it will only rain on Sunday-Wednesday. If it's any other day of the week, it won't be raining. 

===Additional Treehouses===
There are three new smaller treehouses that have been added to Hidden Forest. The seasonal spirits were added near these treehouses.
*The first treehouse can be found to the left of the last section of [[Forest Clearing]], just before the gate to the next area.
*The second treehouse can be found in the [[Forest's Brook]]. From the gate, walk forward until you see the first Darkness plant, then fly upwards and turn left.
*The third treehouse can be found in the [[Boneyard]] section. From the river entrance, fly upwards and to the right.

==Daily Quests & Seasonal Candles ==
===Daily Quests ===
Collect Seasonal Candles throughout the Season to trade with the new spirits for their cosmetics.

The Assembly Guide at Home will offer players four Daily Quests to complete every day. Players will earn one seasonal candle per quest completed. Each day the quest giver stands next to a realm's portal, indicating where the day's daily quests may be completed. The chosen realm will also contain four bunches of Seasonal Candles. If players gather the light from all four bunches, they will be able to forge one extra Seasonal Candle. Players who have the Adventure Pass can also claim a Seasonal Candle at Home as a free daily bonus.

==Spirit Memory Quests ==
The Assembly Guide can be found inside The Treehouse area. After entering through the tunnel, head out of the cave and into the large broken tree, where the guide will be. This Spirit will ask you to assemble and bring them a new prop.
===<span id="Quest 1">Quest #1</span>===
The first prop that needs to be assembled is a bookshelf and can be found in the Clearing treehouse. Upon finishing the quest, several bookshelf-like cabinets are added inside and out of the Treehouse.
[[File:Season_of_Assembly_Treehouse_Quest_1.png|link=https://youtu.be/SZcdqqLAqqA|none|thumb|330x330px|Video by Tara]]
The Assembly Guide questions of a way to store things, and tasks you to visit the scouts by the Brook's Campsite to build a bookcase. This quest can be done by yourself, but it's recommended to bring along friends. Burn down the plants scattered around the area and obtain the materials. Upon finishing the quest, several bookshelves will be added inside and out of the Treehouse area.

===<span id="Quest 2">Quest #2</span>===
The Assembly Guide now asks for fire which requires you to build a torch at the Brook's campsite. Unlike the first quest, this task requires the help of another person to find and collect the materials scattered across the river. After completing the task, a fireplace will be added to the treehouse where five people can sit together and chat. Several torches are added, lighting up the entire place.
[[File:Season_of_Assembly_Treehouse_Quest_2.png|link=https://youtu.be/-P4MA_oXlcs|none|thumb|330x330px|Video by Tara]]

===<span id="Quest 3">Quest #3</span>===
For the third quest, you are tasked with building a shelter to cover from the rain which can be built at the Boneyard treehouse. This task now requires three people to gather the materials needed to build the shelter. Once the task is finished, multiple awning-like shelters adorn the Treehouse. Glowing fungi will appear to grow off of the trees.
[[File:Season_of_Assembly_Treehouse_Quest_3.png|link=https://youtu.be/TkoVd5LOzwE|none|thumb|330x330px|Video by Tara]]

===<span id="Quest 4">Quest #4</span>===
For this task, the Guide entails you to build a lantern-like spotlight to light up the Treehouse even more. This time, it will require the help of four people to collect and build the materials at the Forest's Clearing where the first quest can be completed. After the task is complete, a spotlight will be added to shine over the center of the Treehouse. Sightings of light jellyfish similar to those in the Boneyard will appear as well.
[[File:Season_of_Assembly_Treehouse_Quest_4.png|link=https://youtu.be/e0p8e5Ckkts|none|thumb|330x330px|Video by Tara]]

===<span id="Quest 5">Quest #5</span>===
This time around, the Assembly Guide requests for a place to take a nap in the form of a hammock. Similar to the second week task, the hammock can be assembled at the Forest's Brook campsite with the help of two people. Upon completion, multiple hammocks are added to the Treehouse. Chat benches, as well as a manta, are added to the Treehouse's surroundings.
[[File:Season_of_Assembly_Treehouse_Quest_5.png|link=https://youtu.be/tPnY0a_U6Mc|none|thumb|330x330px|Video by Tara]]

===<span id="Quest 6">Quest #6</span> ===
The sixth and final prop that needs assembly this season is an aerial hoop which can be built by visiting the Boneyard treehouse. Similar to the first week's task, it requires only one player to complete it. Finishing the task adds several floating hoops around the Treehouse which players can fly through and receive a flight boost. The rain in the area is also removed.

==[[Assembly Guide#Additional Props|Additional Cosmetics and Props]]==
This season introduced a new line of items, or [[props]], to collect from the [[Assembly Guide]] after finishing quests. These can be redeemed by spending white candles or hearts and accessed through the [[Props]] [[Outfit Shrine]]. Since these props are part of the Treehouse Quests, they have continued to be available to collect after the Season of Assembly ended.

All of these props are placeable and can be used in [[Shared Spaces]]

==Trivia==
*Season of Assembly was the first Season to have different pendant appearance compare to the last 8 seasonal events, which is a scarf pendant instead of a necklace.
*The Assembly Guide is the first Seasonal Guide that can interact with players with high five, hug or double five.
*The appearance of the neckerchief (the season necklace) is based off of the scouts, an organization for children all around the world that also focuses on outdoor activities and crafts much like the spirits of this season.
*Seasonal emblem are also considered Scout-inspired.
*More information can be found on the season's launch article on the thatskygame website: [https://thatskygame.com/news/a-return-to-hidden-forest-with-season-of-assembly Season of Assembly launch article] (The names of the expressions are sourced from that article.)
**The Assembly Spirits are Scout.
**The three small treehouses are Scouts' basecamps.
