<section begin="Summary" />The '''r/Skyplace project''' was a community project started by u/earthel3ment and u/s4nsky to participate in Reddit's April Fool's event, r/place, which was a social experiment that allowed Reddit users to place pixels in a shared online canvas. The event lasted for four days in 2022, and six days in 2023.

Due to the unregulated content on the canvas, r/Skyplace was not advertised on the official Sky Discord. However, Sky developers did see the project and parts of the pixel art were used as emojis on the official Sky Discord.<section end="Summary" />

==2023 Event==
The '''2023 r/Skyplace project returned on July 20''' with 356 members.<ref>Based on the SkyPlace Discord server count (2023)</ref> The main goal was to create Sky artwork featuring the user "SanSky" (u/s4nsky) as the artwork's main subject instead of a [[Glossary of Terms#Moth|moth]] to serve as a memorial, as he was one of the founders of the r/Skyplace project who tragically passed away due to cancer the previous year.

===A Close Shave with a Streamer===
On the third day of the event, a Russian streamer by the name of Dakeoffc went live on Twitch, directing his audience to build a large portrait of the character "Om Nom" from the game ''Cut The Rope.'' His first attempt was successful, and the portrait was built directly next to the main SkyPlace mural. While this worried some, tensions escalated once he began planning a second mural to the right of the first, which would completely overrun the team's work. Several members of the team raced to his livestream's chat to attempt to reason with him, and after explaining that the artwork was a tribute piece to a friend who'd passed on, and enough of the team pleaded for him to find another spot, Dakeoffc eventually obliged, relocating elsewhere to build a portrait of the Penguins from the ''Madagascar'' film series. The SkyPlace team rejoiced upon seeing a message appear in the stream chat bearing the repeated phrase, "SKY WE WILL NOT TOUCH YOU".

===The Moroccan Flag Disaster and "Operation Reclaim"===
[[File:MainSkyMural.png|right|180x180px]]

The Sky artwork was overrun by a Moroccan streamer after 1337 - a coding school based in the same country -temporarily disabled the bots maintaining their artwork. The streamer took this as an opportunity to direct his viewers to create a massive Moroccan flag in the same location, which completely engulfed the main SkyPlace artwork due to its proximity to 1337. Once 1337 returned, the streamer relocated, and SkyPlace users were able to restore the art back to its original state during an event that they dubbed "Operation Reclaim".

==2022 Event==
The '''2022 r/Skyplace project''' was a community project with approximately 194 members.<ref>Based on the SkyPlace Discord server count (2022)</ref> r/SkyPlace was started by u/earthel3ment to participate in Reddit's April Fool's event, r/place. The 2022 event was notable for serving as the birthplace of several traditions that returned in the 2023 project, most notably the creation of the "Mothalisa" portrait by Hann.hua, the act of "adopting" nearby smaller artwork rather than destroying it, and the celebratory "End of the World Stream" voice call on the official SkyPlace Discord server at the event's conclusion.
