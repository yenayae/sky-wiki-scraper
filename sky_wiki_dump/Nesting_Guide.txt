===<span id="Ultimate Prop"><span id="Prop">Nesting Ultimate Prop</span></span>===
The Nesting Ultimate [[Prop]] is a miniaturized figurine of the player standing on a small mound of grass, posed with their hand held out in front of them like they are offering to {{Icon|Icon handhold.png|link=Friendship Menu#Holding Hands|label=Hold Hands}} [[Friendship Menu#Holding Hands|Hold Hands]]. It is a placeable Prop that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]]. When placed down, the figurine is displayed wearing an exact copy of the players' current cosmetics and height. Interacting with the placed item then gives players the ability to wear the outfit on display for a quick changeup.  

Note that the Mini Figurine cannot be used to display Props and that it only allows players to wear displayed items that they already own. [[Spells]] can be used and will be displayed on the figurine, but will not be applied when you return to don the saved outfit. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item, available for {{Cost|2 SH|season=Nesting}} after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node. <br>
