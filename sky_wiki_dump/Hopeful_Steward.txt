==Personality==
On October 14, 2023, TGC officially announced and introduced the Hopeful Steward with the following personality traits:

*üëÄ Patient and wise beyond their years.
*üí™ Stubborn and strong-willed, doesn't back down easily
*üß† Had to be resourceful, and got by on very little
*ü•∞ Beneath their guarded exterior lies a caring and warm heart

==Trivia==
* The Hopeful Steward is the fourth [[Ancestors#Guides|Seasonal Guide]], after [[the Rose]], [[the Void of Shattering]], and [[AURORA Guide|AURORA]] to have a unique name that differs from the standard "(Season name) Guide" format.
** Additionally, the Hopeful Steward is the first Seasonal Guide to be ''introduced'' with a traditional Spirit name. The [[Gratitude Guide|Auspicious Visitor]] and [[Enchantment Guide|Enchanted Pyrotechnician]] were only given this trait after they'd been initially introduced with the standard "(Season name) Guide" format.
* The option to Hug the Hopeful Steward after completing Quest #3 wasn't available initially and was instead added towards the end of the Season in Patch {{v|0.23.5}}.
*Prior to the {{v|0.25.0}} Update, the second Seasonal Quest involved unlocking the [[Blessings_(Spells)#Message_Boat_Spell|Message Boat Spells]] inside the [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Spell Shop]] in Aviary Village. This Quest was then removed from the [[Hopeful Steward]]'s Quest Tree, reducing the total number of Revival Quests from ten to nine, while also changing the numbered order of the subsequent Quests.
