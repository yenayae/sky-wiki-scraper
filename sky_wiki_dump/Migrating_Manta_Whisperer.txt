<div>{{#ev:youtube|3Pmg7hAMKwQ|200px|inline|Video Guide}}

The Migrating Manta Whisperer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on top of a high mountain at the right and back of the area, near the [[Talented Builder]], by a gate above the chime workshop. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Manta Whisperer can be seen conducting a [[Manta]] race, with the [[Backflipping Champion]] and [[Proud Victor]] as contestants, each kneeling on one of the Light Creatures. The Whisperer raises two hand-held flags to signal the Spirits to get ready, but they accidentally fly off early. After panicking a bit, the Whisperer manages to catch up to the Spirits, and continues to signal them to "set", and finally, "go!". During the race, the Spirits are accompanied by more Mantas that fly alongside them. While the Migrating Manta Whisperer continues to navigate the contestants and Manta herd around the area, the Backflipping Champion leads the race the entire time. But then, shortly before the end, the Proud Victor catches up and flies through the goal post as victor of the race. 

At the end of the memory, the Migrating Manta Whisperer strikes a pose while navigating the Spirits with the flags. Shortly after, they applaude the Backflipping Champion and Proud Victor, which bow in return. Then, they turns around to see a swarm of Mantas fly across the area, quietly stunning the Spirits with their presence.

*Level 1 will make your avatar hold two red, hand-held flags into the air, then widen the V-shape of their arms, look around, and finally jump and wave the flags behind them, after which they are leaned close to the ground and peek up. With each motion, a whistle sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with golden sparkles following the avatar's hands, as well as a circle appearing above their head, differently-colored with each motion; first red, then yellow, and lastly green.
*Level 3 will make your avatar strike flag signaling poses in different directions according to which buttons you press on a pop-up menu. This pop-up menu is identical to the menu used by the player to hit specific notes when playing an [[Instrument]].
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with white glowing halos appearing around the avatar's hands with each pose.
<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
