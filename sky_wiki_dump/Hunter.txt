== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|BxsqFIA5pYs|200px|inline|Video Guide}}

The Hunter can be found in the [[Crescent Oasis]], on top of the stone ledge that features a [[Murals|Mural]] near the pool of water. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Hunter spots a pair of [[Mantas]] flying nearby and begins to hunt them, carefully sneaking closer with a net in hand. As the Spirit closes in, they start running and launch the net towards the fleeing creatures.

At the end of the memory, the Hunter has managed to net one of the Mantas while the other escapes, safe from capture. Pleased by this success, the Hunter stands over their quarry and strikes a pose, proudly flexing both arms.

*Level 1 will make your avatar perform the iconic front double biceps pose; puffing out their chest and stretching out both arms, flexed at the elbows, while a short drum sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a white glow around your avatar's hands and a bright pink star near their head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar strike unique flexing poses according to which buttons are pressed on a pop-up menu while short drum sound effects play. This pop-up menu is identical to the menu used by the player to hit specific notes when playing an [[Instrument]].
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with the addition of small sparkles surrounding your avatar's hands as they pose, and a bright pink star when pressing the button in the center of the popup menu.
