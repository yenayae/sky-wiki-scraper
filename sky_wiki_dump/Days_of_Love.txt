'''Days of Love''' is an annual event celebrating moments together with friends and loved ones for Valentine's Day that happens around the middle of February and lasting until the end of the month.

During the two-week event, the Auspicious Visitor from [[Days of Fortune]] extends their stay as the event Spirit as soft and cheerful [[Pieces of Light|Light]] drops up to a certain amount of Social Light for players to gather each day. Head over to the redecorated pier with a new floral theme, to say hello and to check out Spells for the event from the diminutive boat-shaped container next to the Auspicious Visitor! The [[Secret Area]] is open for the duration of the event and free [[Spells]] for Message Boats are temporarily transformed into pink cranes.

Valentine's-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] are available from the in-game shop, and the Auspicious Visitor and Days of Love Event Staff offer various cosmetics from their Friendship Trees. Free Spells to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy Traveler's Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] and the boat-shaped Mini Spell Shop at the event area.

==February 2025 <span id="2025"></span>==
To celebrate all the different connections at the heart of Sky, and beyond—Days of Love returned for a sixth year! The event began on '''Monday, February 10, 2025 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and continued until '''Sunday, February 23, 2025 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)'''. For the duration of the event, the Days of Love Guide; the [[Jolly Geologist]], appeared in the [[Aviary Village]] and [[Home]] to teleport players to where the event took place: the [[Jellyfish Cove]] in [[Starlight Desert]].

An amethyst-colored meteorite fell from the starry skies and landed in the ocean far from the shores of the Jellyfish Cove. Up to 4 Tickets’ worth could be collected from the meteorite each day, by using [[Expressions]] next to the small crystals at its base. There were also 15 bow-shaped bonus Event Tickets located in the area to find throughout the event. The meteor showers, [[Spirits]], and floating [[Pieces of Light]] also returned from [[Days of Love#February 2024|last year's event]].

Every Heart and partial Heart gift players giifted to friends through the Friendship Constellation or Friendship Tree during Days of Love were doubled.  (Note that if a gift was sent before Days of Love began but was then collected during the event, it would not be doubled.)

{{#ev:youtube|L3rfWfIGvGY|400|right|Daily Ticket Guide}}
{{Cost|4 T|event=love}} by using [[Expressions]] collected from [[Spirits]] of the designated [[Realms]] near the small clusters of crystals each day.
* There were 3 section of crystals, each assigned to a different Realm.
* A correct expression would cause the crystals to glow. When an expression from an incorrect Realm was used, the crystals turned dark blue. Alternatively, players could automatically activate an entire section by performing a [[Expressions#Friend Actions|friend action]].
* Once all the small cluster of crystals were active in a section, the medium crystal rewarded players with light for {{Cost|1 T|event=love}}.
* Once all 3 sections were illuminated, the large crystal in the center would glow, rewarding the final Ticket.

In addition, bonus {{Cost|15 T|event=love}} one-time Event Tickets shaped like bows were hidden throughout the [[Starlight Desert#Jellyfish Cove|Jellyfish Cove]]. They could be collected at any time during the event.

== February 2024 <span id="2024"></span>==
{{#ev:youtube|pIEcktFLnuU||right|Days of Love 2024 Trailer}}
Days of Love returned for a fourth year with new updates and experiences to share! The event began on '''Monday, February 12, 2024 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and ended on '''Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''14''' days and overlapping with [[Days of Fortune]] for three days. For the duration of the event, the heart-shaped Unfettered Love appeared in the [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to [[Starlight Desert#Jellyfish Cove|Jellyfish Cove]] in Starlight Desert, which was revamped specially for the occasion. In addition, the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate. 

Under a tranquil starlit sky, a series of [[Spirits]] from past [[Seasons]] arrived to greet players every two days, each reflecting the different kinds of relationships that shape our lives—and even offered the chance to play music together as the end of the event approached! Nearby, a special flower granted players the ability to freely place down a new type of [[Days of Love#Message Gondola Spell|Message Boat]]. [[Social Light]] would also gently float down to the sands. Looking overhead, players could catch the sparkling glow of a meteor shower '''twice every hour''' for 10 minutes, from '''xx:05''' to '''xx:15''' and '''xx:35''' to '''xx:45'''.

It was the perfect time for [[Double Currency Events|double Hearts]], so across the two weeks of the event, every Heart gift and partial Heart gift sent to friends were doubled! (Note that if a gift was sent before Days of Love began but was then collected during the event, it would not be doubled.) [[Home]] kept its snowy appearance before revealing a fresh cover of pink grass in the final days of the event, and the [[Secret Area]] accessible from the [[Vault of Knowledge]] featured snow and ice to enjoy winter-themed games and skating moves.

<small>Days of Love content was available to all players who had at least started the [[Season of Revival#Quest #4|4th Quest]] from the [[Hopeful Steward]] in [[Aviary Village]].</small><br>

[[File:Days-of-Love-2023-TGC-Promo-image.png|thumb|200px|right|Promotional image - Days of Love 2023]]
Days of Love returned for a fourth year! The event began '''Monday, February 13, 2023 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and ended '''Sunday, February 26, 2023 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Auspicious Visitor appeared in [[Home]] and the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate.

Now is the time to appreciate the relationships that connect us all through the game, in ways large and small. For starters, all Hearts and Light Gifts sent while the event was active were [[Double Currency Events#Days of Love - February 2023|doubled]] for the recipient. (Note that if a gift is sent before Days of Love begins but is then collected during the event, it will not be doubled.)

Home took on a warm and inviting appearance, with pink grass and a freshly redecorated pier offering a welcoming place to gather. A soft mist added its ambience, offering up to a certain amount of [[Pieces of Light|Light]] each day, particularly during the first week of the event.

<small>Days of Love content was available to all players who have progressed through at least [[Hidden Forest]].</small>
