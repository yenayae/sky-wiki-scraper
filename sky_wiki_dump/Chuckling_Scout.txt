<section begin="Summary" />The '''Chuckling Scout''' is a [[Seasonal Spirit]] from the [[Season of Assembly]] who offers the {{Emote|Chuckling Scout|inline_text}} Expression. The Chuckling Scout is found in the [[Forest Boneyard]], on a platform outside the Boneyard's treehouse. The collectibles [[#Traveling Spirit|offered]] by this Spirit are an {{Spirit Item|Chuckling Scout|Outfit|inline_text}}, {{Spirit Item|Chuckling Scout|Footwear|inline_text}}, a {{Spirit Item||Mask|inline_text}}, and a {{Spirit Item|Chuckling Scout|Prop|label=Hoop Prop|inline_text}}.<section end="Summary" />

== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|pzaNKgM5m88||inline|Video Guide}}

The Chuckling Scout can be found in the [[Hidden Forest#Boneyard|Boneyard]], positioned around the perimeter of a small treehouse on the player's immediate right if entering from the [[Forest's Brook]]. The [[Daydream Forester]] is also located on the outside of this treehouse; the Chuckling Scout and the [[Daydream Forester]] can be found on opposite sides of the structure. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

Be wary while reliving this memory because the Spirit can be damaged by the [[Spirit Health|polluted rain]]. Be quick to collect the fragments and make sure to bring a friend to recharge.

As their memory unfolds, the Chuckling Scout and the [[Daydream Forester]] can be seen walking around the perimeter of the treehouse, on the far side of the small stream. The two appear to be gathering sticks before [[Daydream Forester]] is distracted from the task and wanders off. The Chuckling Scout follows their friend, sneaking along behind their fellow, preoccupied, Spirit. The [[Daydream Forester]] does not seem to notice the Chuckling Scout following along behind them, striking funny poses.

At the end of the memory, the Chuckling Scout silently stands behind the Daydream Forester, waiting for the other Spirit to finally notice them. Not realizing that the Chuckling Scout had been following behind them the entire time, the Forester turns around and jumps in alarm. After their sneaky surprise, the Chuckling Scout lets out a small chuckle, shaking their head in amusement.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar lift their left hand to their lower half of the face as if muffling a chuckle, their shoulders shaking as they laugh, finishing their act off with a slight shake of the head, while whistling sound effects, accompanied by chimes, that together sound like chuckling sounds, play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with white starburst particles popping up in front of your avatar's face.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean back and hold both hands to their stomach as they heartily laugh, before stopping to look around and cover their mouth first with one hand, then the other, as if they've realized they have been caught laughing, while whistling sound effects, accompanied by chimes, that together sound like chuckling sounds, play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with many pink starburst particles popping up in front of your avatar's face.

As a Returning Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
