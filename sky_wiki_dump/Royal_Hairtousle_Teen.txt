*Level 1 will make your avatar lean forward, lift both hands to their face and rapidly blink several times, while a row of ascending tones plays. They will then continue to look to one side, then the other, before resuming their previous stance. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a white halo of light surrounding the player's head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar rapidly blink several times before rubbing their eyes, shaking their head and looking forward, while sound effects accompany the blinking and rubbing motions. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with first a glowing exclamation mark, then a question mark, flickering above the player's head as they blink and look up, and golden sparkles flying away from their eyes as they rub them.

<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
