The Modest Dancer can be found in the [[Village Theater]], behind the second building from the player's immediate right when entering from [[Village of Dreams]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Modest Dancer can be seen sneaking behind a row of buildings towards a small clearing. They make sure no one is following them, and once they are alone, they are seen performing different dance moves. Suddenly, the [[Forgetful Storyteller]] finds the Modest Dancer and approaches the Dancer to say hello. Startled, the Dancer rushes out of the clearing. The Storyteller follows the Dancer, and takes them by the sleeve to encourage the shy Dancer to continue their routine behind the row of buildings. The two walk back to the clearing, Dancer seeming more reluctant than the Storyteller. The Forgetful Storyteller attempts to get the Dancer to open up, and the two continue the dance routine together.

At the end of the memory, the Modest Dancer puts their hands over each other on their lap and shyly sways from left to right in response to Storyteller's request to dance, and the two Spirits dance as a duet.

*Level 1 will make your avatar step forward with their right foot and open both arms in front of your friend. When your friend accepts your offer to dance, you will both step from side to side, crossing one foot in front of the other as you do so. Your arms will drift and wave in the direction opposite to where you step, all in time to rhythmic background music.
*Level 2 will make your avatar step forward with their left foot, lean back slightly, and open both arms in front of your friend. When your friend accepts your offer to dance, you will both step forward with your left foot and kick back with your right foot opposite from one another. When you kick back with your left foot, your friend will step forward with their right, and vice versa. With each step, you will swing your arms from one side to the other. Rhythmic background music also plays during this Level, but has a quicker tempo than the music heard in Level 1.

Like any [[Friendship Menu#Extended Two-Player Abilities|Extended Two-Player Abilities]], this ability can be upgraded by opening your friend's Friendship Menu. To reach the 13th node before the ability, it will cost you {{Cost|57 C}} and {{Cost|16 AC}}. (See [[Friendship Menu]] to view the entire Friendship Tree). Unlocking the Level 1 ability will cost you {{Cost|20 C}}. After unlocking Level 1, it will cost you {{Cost|22 C}} more to upgrade to Level 2.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the Friend Action upgrade was {{Cost|8 H}}. During the Season, Level 1 was free, but Level 2 was only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
