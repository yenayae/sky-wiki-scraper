<section begin="Summary"/>The [[Season of Dreams]] also brought along the Hermit Valley, home to the [[Bearhug Hermit]]. The Valley can be found high above the Village of Dreams, and can only be entered via a Gondola from the Village itself. {{Wind Pathway|2}}, to the right of the Hermit's cave. To enter, you must first start the [[Season of Dreams#Quest 3|3rd Seasonal Quest]] from the [[Dreams Guide]], which activates a new button for players to interact with at the very top of the Village slope. Lighting the button will unlock a Gondola leading up to the Hermit Valley. There is only one Spirit to be found here; the young skater, which was part of the 3rd Seasonal Quest. Additionally there is a [[Map Shrine]] atop the Hermit's cave.

==Overview==
The tranquil Hermit Valley sits atop the Village of Dreams, serving as the home for the [[Bearhug Hermit]]. With snow-covered mountains and dangerous cliffs, the area holds a slope which can be raced down using the race feature atop the Hermit's cave (next to the Map Shrine). Race with one other friend to gain 150-300 pieces of light. The slopes also serve as the main spot for the Dreams Guide [[Season of Dreams#Quest 3|Quest #3]], racing down the slopes and cliffs to collect every light fragment before the time limit.

===Child of Light Locations===
There are a total of '''2''' [[Children of Light#Hermit Valley|Children of Light]] in the area.
