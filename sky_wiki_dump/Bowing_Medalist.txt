The Bowing Medalist can be found at the very top of the [[Coliseum]] stadium seating, to the right of the Temple entrance. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 8 memory fragments and a 4-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Bowing Medalist races down the ramp in between the stadium seats on the very right side of the Coliseum. The Spirit then leaps off of the ramp and into the ice rink in the center of the Coliseum, where they perform a series of complicated spins and jumps all across the rink.

At the end of the memory, the Bowing Medalist stands on the center podium upon finishing their performance. They wave to the onlookers in the Coliseum before taking a bow.<br>

==Trivia== 
*Before December 2020, the Bowing Medalist was one of two Spirits (the other being [[Backflipping Champion]]) found in the [[Flying Race]]. Players would have to fly into the Spirit during the race and could then receive their Expression at the end of the race in the [[Coliseum]]. After Patch {{v|0.13.0}}, both the Backflipping Champion and Bowing Medalist were relocated and given memories to relive.
* The Bowing Medalist is one of only four [[Regular Spirits]] (the others being [[Manta Whisperer]], [[Backflipping Champion]], and [[Proud Victor]]) whose memory has a [[Timed Memory|time limit]].
