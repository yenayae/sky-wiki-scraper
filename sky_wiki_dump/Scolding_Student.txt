==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|PmGCb1-bD_E||inline|Video Guide}}

The Scolding Student can be found in the third area of the [[Forest Clearing]] in [[Hidden Forest]], to the left of the exit gate, below the first treehouse steps. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
Players should be wary of the rain; it is advised to bring a friend to recharge or an umbrella if you have one. As with any spirits under the rain, it will expire if left too long under the rain, so be sure to collect the memory in time before it fades away.<br>
<br>
As their memory unfolds, the Baffled Botanist can be seen hiding behind the treehouse and looking at the Scolding Student, who seems to be examining different natural things around the threehouse. 

At the end of the memory the Baffled Botanist can be seen kneeling in front of a lantern with their back to the Student. The Student scolds them but the Botanist stands up, turns around, and gives the light to the Student. The Scolding Student seems moved by the offering.<br>

* Level 1 will make your avatar lean a bit forward and bend their head to the side, before raising their right arm and moving it in a scolding motion, while a tinking sound effect in rhythm with the arm's motion plays, the last note being in a higher pitch than the others.
* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a light-blue trail of light following the movement of your avatar's raised hand.
* Level 3 will make your avatar abruptly stand up straight, putting their feet together and their hands on their hips before leaning forward and raising their right arm to make a scolding movement. At the end, they resume their position from the beginning and relax. During the Expression, a tinking sound effect plays in rhythm with the avatar's movements.
* Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a light-blue trail of light following your avatar's hands.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
