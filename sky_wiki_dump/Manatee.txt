}}<section begin="Summary" />This yellow and white creature is a blend of manatee, porpoise, and seal. It first appeared during [[Days of Nature]] 2023 and is now a permanent resident in [[Prairie Peaks]] where a herd of these peaceful manatees can be found sunbathing at the flowing river.<section end="Summary" />

During [[Days of Nature]] 2023 players found it trapped in the sand by a Darkness Plant in Sanctuary Island at the shore of the Island that the turtle lives close to. After freeing the manatee, it guided the player to a massive water vortex.

In the following year, it could be spotted in Sanctuary Islands again as part of the Days of Nature 2024 [[Days of Nature#Daily Quest|daily quests]].

More recently, the manatee has taken on a significant role in the [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1|Season of the Two Embers]] and its related animation, becoming a memorable part of the unfolding story. A {{Emote|Stern Shepherd|inline_text}} is now available through the [[Stern Shepherd]]. Using the [[Stern Shepherd#Prop|Stern Shepherd Staff]], an item locked behind the [[Seasonal Events#Season Pass|Season Pass]], in a place where manatees live makes them fly over and accompany the player until told to stop or when leaving the area.
