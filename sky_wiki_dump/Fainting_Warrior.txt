The Fainting Warrior can be found on the left side of [[Broken Temple]], behind one of the ruined columns. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 2 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Fainting Warrior stumbles across the sandy dunes towards another ruined column farther ahead.

At the end of the memory, the Fainting Warrior staggers alongside the column, clutching their left shoulder as if they were wounded. Eventually, unable to keep moving, they collapse onto all fours and pass out.<br>

* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with white clouds and the letter "z" continuously appearing from your avatar's head.
* Level 3 will make your avatar slouch forward, then backward, before collapsing back onto their right side. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
* Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with white clouds and the letter "z" continuously appearing from your avatar's head, with a circling ring of sparkles overhead.
