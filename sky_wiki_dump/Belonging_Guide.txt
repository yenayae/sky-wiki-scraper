<section begin="Summary" />The '''Belonging Guide''' (also known as '''Grandma''') is a Seasonal Guide from the [[Season of Belonging]] who offered [[Belonging Guide#Ultimate Gifts|cosmetics]] and no Quests during that Season. The Belonging Guide was only found at [[Home]] during the Season and, outside of their appearances as host of a [[Additional Light Sources#Grandma's Dinner Event|Social Light Event]], cannot be found today since they are no longer present in the game. The Ultimate Guide offered a {{Spirit Item|Belonging Guide|necklace_u|inline_text|link=Belonging Guide#Belonging Ultimate Pendant}} and a {{Spirit Item||prop_u|inline_text|link=Belonging Guide#Belonging Ultimate Prop}} for [[Season Pass]] holders.<section end="Summary" />

==<span id="Ultimate Pendant"><span id="Belonging Ultimate Pendant">Seasonal Pendant</span></span>==
The Belonging Ultimate [[Necklace|Pendant]] is the usual gold pendant featuring the Season's emblem attached to a necklace. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available for free from the Friendship Tree's first node.<br>

==Ultimate Gifts==
The Belonging Guide offered 1 Ultimate Gift, available to be purchased by [[Season Pass]] holders with [[Currency#Season Hearts|Seasonal Hearts]] during the Season of Belonging only.

===<span id="Ultimate Prop">Belonging Ultimate Prop</span>===
The Belonging Ultimate [[Prop]] is a bonfire surrounded on three sides by simple log benches. It is a placeable Prop that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]], and functions as a four-player [[Chat]] item. The bonfire at the center can be lit to recharge the player's [[Winged Light|Cape Energy]]. When carried on the player's back, it appears as three pieces of firewood tied together by two yellow strings. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available for {{Season Heart|6|season=Belonging}} after unlocking the Friendship Tree's first node.<br>

==Quest Tree==
Unlike later Ultimate Guides, the Belonging Guide did not have a Quest Tree since there were no Seasonal Quests. Instead, the [[Season of Belonging#Spirits and Cosmetics|Seasonal Spirits]] were individually released over the course of the Season, with one added each week.
