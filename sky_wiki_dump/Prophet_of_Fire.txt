<div>{{#ev:youtube|wup0dXxlEn4||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Prophet of Fire can be found in the [[Cave of Prophecies]], near the entrance to the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Fire|Trial of Fire]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 5-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Prophet of Fire can be seen educating a pair of younger Spirits about the history of the Cave. The Prophet of Fire first greets the young Spirits before directing them to a seating area at the center of the Cave of Prophecies. Together, they sit with a larger group of Spirits listening intently to the lessons being provided by all four of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#All_Prophecy_Friendship_Trees|Prophets]]. The group then splits up as the Prophet of Fire takes their students aside, enthusiastically leading them towards the entrance of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Fire|Trial of Fire]]. The Spirit takes a seat on a rocky ledge to continue the lesson.

At the end of the memory, the Prophet of Fire teaches the younger Spirits about courage by pounding their chest and pumping a fist with pride.<br>
