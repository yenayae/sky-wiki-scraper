}}

In late September the bonfires are stoked for Lazy Days, beginning on '''00:00 Monday, September 26''' and continuing through '''23:59 Sunday, October 16, 2022'''. There's no rushing or hurrying, just a warm fire in Home that will share its Light with Sky children—smaller amounts at the first, larger amounts later on. Players are also able to get some light by lighting seashells. Themed items for this event were offered through the Summer Guide and in-game shop. Visit the Sleepy's Traveler boat for unique spells. 

Starting in 2022, [[Days of Summer]] and [[Days of Summer Lights]] combined to become, Lazy Days.
