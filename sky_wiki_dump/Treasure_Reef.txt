<section begin="Summary" />Version {{v|0.16.0}} added an area for [[Season of Abyss]] to the Golden Wasteland; Treasure Reef. On the right of the social space, there will be a pier with a boat. Take the boat and sail through the dark cloud of Wasteland into a crystal clear water paradise. The Treasure Reef is home to multiple creatures and acts as the tutorial for the ''Diving'' Mechanic, where the player unlocks the feature. Note that the boat will display only if a player has progressed at least to Vault of Knowledge. The Treasure Reef lets players seek the mysteries and surprises that await in the sapphire depths of the reef.<section end="Summary"/>

The [[Treasure Reef]] is an enchanting underwater area. As you descend into its depths, you are greeted by a mesmerizing display of vibrant coral reefs and sparkling underwater caves. The reef is teeming with schools of colorful fish, swimming through the mystic underwater buildings and strange architecture. Players are able to learn the ''Diving'' Mechanic in the beginning cave. The mechanic allows the player to dive underwater anywhere in Sky, from [[Sanctuary Islands]]' reefs to the [[Isle of Dawn]]'s shores. Dive into the mysteries of the Treasure Reef and swim alongside dazzling Light Creatures, or venture beyond the shallows in search of secrets that lurk far below. 

The [[Abyss Guide]] can be found on the ship floating in Treasure Reef (on the left-hand side of the reef) who invites players to delve into the reef and uncover it's secrets. A map of the reef is laid out on a table next to the guide. In the area surrounding the Guide are 4 [[Seasonal Spirits]], which upon completing, will give you their unique [[Expression]]. <section end="Overview" />

Seasonal Quests from the [[Season of Abyss]] are available to complete in the Treasure Reef. A series of quests entailing the player to delve in the reef and uncover it's various secrets. There are 5 quests, each asking the player to collect resources for the Spirits in the Treasure Reef. Each quest adds an X to this map indicating approximately where the player needs to go for that quest. Use the landmarks and hallmarks of the area to figure out where to go.

===Shared Space===
A Shared Space found on the left shores near the staircase to decorate with Props. You can have up to 16 props available at a time on your Shared Space, but can be much less depending on the "load" of the props as determined by how much the top bar fills up. Once a prop is in use, it will stay where you left it as long as you don't move it or remove it. The items are sorted by how much "load” they use in a Shared Space, listed from left to right.
