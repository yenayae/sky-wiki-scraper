== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|clZJGuOCgYc||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Wise Grandparent can be found on a square platform at the start of the [[The Archives|Archives]] in Vault of Knowledge, in the large room before the maze. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

[[Deep Call|Deep Calling]] is recommended to stunt the many [[Dark Crabs]] inhabiting the hallways of the Archives, to prevent them from attacking the player during the memory.

As their memory unfolds, the Wise Grandparent can be seen ponderously exploring the maze-like Archives until they reach its end.

At the end of the memory, the Wise Grandparent stands thoughtfully with their hands clasped behind their back. The player then grabs a bell from underneath their Cape and rings it, catching the attention of the Spirit. They bring their hand to their chin and think for a short while, before they raise up their arm in epiphany, with a glowing exclamation mark blinking above their head.<br>
