The Festival Spin Dancer can be found in the [[Bird Nest]], underneath the landing platform at the entrance of the area when arriving from the [[Butterfly Fields]]. They are located on the bottom left of the hill that supports the platform. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 3 memory fragments and a 3-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Festival Spin Dancer can be seen making their way up the hill and to the stone steps to arrive at the landing platform that faces the area's many floating islands.

At the end of the memory, the Festival Spin Dancer takes a bow, hands held straight at their sides, before launching into a spinning dance that they invite the player to imitate.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar throw up their right hand before completing two spins: first making a little jump before spinning to the right and then the left. The dance ends with their left hand extended above their head and the right stretched toward their right foot, face turned to follow the gesture, while rhythmic percussion sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a pink star trailed by sparkles spinning around your dancing avatar.
*Level 3 will make your avatar strike unique dance poses according to which buttons you press on a pop-up menu while fun, short percussion accents play. This pop-up menu is identical to the menu used by the player to hit specific notes when playing an [[Instrument]].
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with small sparkles appearing from your avatar's hands.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were a non-standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|5 H}}, and {{Cost|10 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
