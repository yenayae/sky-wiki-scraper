== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|rUjIYqEcG7M||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Sparkler Parent is found in the [[Valley of Triumph#Temple Maze|Maze]] in the Valley Temple, on the player's left as soon as they enter the Temple, blocked by a Spirit Gate that requires the player to have relived at least one Regular Spirit from [[Golden Wasteland]]. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 10 memory fragments and a 20-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

If the player has not relived at least one Regular Spirit from Golden Wasteland yet, they can also enter through the Maze's exit, which is not blocked by any barrier. The Maze's exit is also located at the player's left when entering the Temple, but higher up on the third section from left to right.

To relive the Sparkler Parent's memory, players will journey through the dark Maze. To help see more clearly through the darkness, players can bring out their candle from the Menu, or activate a [[Blessings (Spells)#Glow Spell|Glow Spell]]. At several points throughout the memory, it is required to drop down a level, which can best be done by carefully dropping or flying down a wall or edge while pulling the light with them. Crabs can also be found in some areas, which can be stunned by letting out a [[Deep Call]].

As their memory unfolds, the Sparkler Parent can be seen making their way through the maze while holding a lantern to light the way. Having reached their destination in a small room with several boxes, pots, and decorative candles, they pick up a box with small fireworks, candles, and sparklers in it. Outside of the maze, they showcase some sparklers to the Boogie Kid and Confetti Cousin, who each have their hands brought together and lean forward in awe.

At the end of the memory, the Sparkler Parent lights sparklers and waves them through the air, before the Boogie Kid and Confetti Cousin repeat the same. The player then grabs a bell from underneath their cape and rings it, causing the Sparkler Parent to stop. They bring their hand to their chin and think for a short while, before they raise up their arm in epiphany, with a glowing exclamation mark blinking above their head.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar position themselves sideways, before pulling out a sparkler from their hands and waving it through the air like the infinity symbol with their outstretched left arm, with their focus locking on their hand's motion, while a sound similar to igniting a match and a sparkler burning down and twinkling sound effects play. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a glowing white trail of light following the motion your avatar's left hand.
*Level 3 will make your avatar pose in certain directions with their sparkler, according to which buttons you press on a 3x3 pop-up menu while sparkler sound effects and varying calm notes, similar to the {{Spirit Item|Tinkering Chimesmith|Instrument|inline_text}}, play. This pop-up menu is similar to the menu used by the player to hit specific notes when playing an [[Instrument]], but smaller.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a glowing white trail of light following the motion of your avatar's left hand.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

When carried on a player's back, the Prop appears in its original form, but without the stick.
