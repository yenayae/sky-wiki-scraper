== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|fILkeV1zji4||inline|Video Guide}}

The Hiking Grouch can be found in the [[Sanctuary Islands]], on a grassy outcrop to the right of the main island when facing its front. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 25-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

During the memory, the Spirit must be carried all the way up the mountain. Certain sections of the path require flying while carrying the Spirit, making this one of the more difficult memories to complete - particularly for players with little [[Winged Light]]. The best way to complete this memory is to slowly fly up against the wall while carrying the light - this ensures that the light does not fall down but instead "climbs up the wall" with the player.

As their memory unfolds, the Hiking Grouch can be seen being lead up the mountain by the [[Sanctuary Guide]]. Together, the two Spirits climb the steps winding around the steep peaks to reach the summit - with the Hiking Grouch looking sullen throughout the entire trek. 

At the end of the memory, the Sanctuary Guide gestures towards the stunning view from the top of the mountain, encouraging their companion to admire the islands' natural beauty. Utterly unimpressed, the Hiking Grouch crosses their arms and turns away, snubbing the Sanctuary Guide's efforts.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar twist their upper body to the side, cross both arms, and turn their head away, before looking back and turning to the side again, while a squeaky sound effect resembling an infant's cry plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a red symbol portraying a popped vein appearing near the head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar take an exaggeratedly big step to the side, their arms with balled fists swinging with the motion, before crossing their arms in a dramatically offended manner and periodically and abruptly looking over their shoulder, while a deeper squeaky sound effect resembling an infant's cry plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with red symbol portraying a popped vein appearing near the head and white light sparkles flying out at the beginning of the motion.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
