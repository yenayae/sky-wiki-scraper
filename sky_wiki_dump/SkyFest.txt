<section begin="Summary" />Inspired by [[Sky Assemblies]], '''SkyFest''' is an event designed to celebrate ''Sky''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Sky Anniversary#July 2024|fifth anniversary]] both in-person and in-game. On July 13 and July 14, 2024, two Sky Assemblies will take place; one in China which will be run by [[NetEase]], and the other in Tokyo, Japan, run by the TGC community management team. As most people won't be able to attend these assemblies, SkyFest will also take place in-game. 

As ''Sky'''s first simultaneously in-person and in-game Sky Assembly event, it shares a similar goal to that of the [[AURORA Concert]]; to build a celebratory, connective experience that can be enjoyed by players around the world. Itâ€™s important that this event meets the moment and honors five years worth of players, stories, friendships, and more.<section end="Summary"/>
