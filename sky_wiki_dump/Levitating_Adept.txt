The Levitating Adept can be found on the [[Second Floor Vault|Second Floor of Vault]], behind the four-player door that must be lifted, hiding behind a column in the back left corner of the room. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 3 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Levitating Adept guides two Spirits around the room, pointing to the various lanterns on the floor-to-ceiling shelves. The Levitating Adept then climbs up a ladder to retrieve a lantern while the other two watch, and the trio proceed to carry the lantern into the center of the room.

At the end of the memory, the Levitating Adept joins two other Spirits attempting to lift a lantern with [[wikipedia:Telekinesis|telekinesis]]. While the other two struggle, the Levitating Adept succeeds, lifting the lantern into the air with ease.<br>
