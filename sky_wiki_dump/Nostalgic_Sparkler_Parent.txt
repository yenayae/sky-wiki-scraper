The [[Hair Accessory]] offered by this Spirit consists of two silver feather-like pieces attached to the side of the head. At the bottom they merge into a curl, from which hangs a large, dark blue diamond. The diamond glows when other Sky kids are nearby, or when someone nearby uses a friendship interaction expression. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's first node ({{Cost|9 SC|season=Blue Bird}} total).<br>
