The Apologetic Lumberjack can be found in [[Boneyard]] next to a large tree stump to the left after entering the area from [[Forest's Brook]]. (Early [[Sky Beta|Beta]] testers know this area as [[Tree Tunnels|"Tree Tunnels."]]) This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 5 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. All of the memory fragments are [[Spirit Health|sheltered]] from the [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Rain|rain]].

As their memory unfolds, the Apologetic Lumberjack is seen using an axe to chop down a large tree. Once they've made enough swings to the felling notch, the humongous tree comes crashing down - and nearly crushes another nearby Spirit.

At the end of the memory, the Apologetic Lumberjack profusely apologizes to the Spirit they nearly squashed, dropping to their hands and knees in a deep bow to demonstrate their sincerity.<br>
