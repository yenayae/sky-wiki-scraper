<div>{{#ev:youtube|v8ecSqd3NOA|thumb|inline|Video Guide}}

The Ascetic Monk can be found in the [[Prairie Peaks]], on the snowy mountain top to the left about halfway through the area. Climb the side of the mountain via a natural path that will take you directly to the Spirit. A few flowers strewn across your path can help you gain back your wing power if you don't have enough to go all the way. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Ascetic Monk can be seen building three structures resembling [[wikipedia:Cairn|cairns]], carefully pilling stones on top of each other to form a triangle. Once completed, they strike a meditative pose at the center and concentrate to balance the rocks - but a strong wind knocks the Spirit off their feet, causing the structures to collapse on themselves. Undeterred, they start over and build the structures back up, once again attempting to achieve balance. 

At the end of the memory, the Ascetic Monk is in harmony with the wind, keeping all three monuments in balance at the same time. However, their concentration soon breaks, and the three monuments fall yet again. Discouraged by the situation, the Ascetic Monk slumps in defeat and lets their arms fall.

*Level 1 will make your avatar lift one foot off the ground and place it inwards on the other thigh, while aso raising both hands into the air, then bring one hand in front of their chest with their palm facing inward and the other on top of their head, palm facing inward as well, while their Cape blows back in the wind. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon doing so, your avatar will first join both hand above their head, before slowly bringing them both down to their sides by keeping their arms straight, as well as bring down their leg. 
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a trail of evenly spaced out glowing white orbs following the motion of your avatar's hands in the beginning and end of the Expression, as well as a multi-layered golden glowing halo appearing around their head as they stay in position.
*Level 3 will make your avatar bend down slightly and slowly move their arms in a rounded shape as if gathering momentum while lifting off the ground, levitating, a knee bent, arms at their sides with their palms facing down, and their Cape flapping with the wind. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with bursts of small, white glowing sparkles bursting outwards in a circle shape from your avatar's hands as they ascend and descend, and big, orange glowing sparkles spiraling around their body as they stay floating.

<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
