<div>{{#ev:youtube|GjUfabmBwvE||inline|Video Guide}}

The Pleaful Parent can be found near the slope at the entrance of the [[Graveyard]], next to the [[Golden Wasteland#Social Light Areas|Bonfire]] surrounded by [[Dark Crabs]] on the player's right when entering from the [[Graveyard Entrance]]. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

This Spirit memory requires players to make their way through territory patrolled by several [[Dark Dragons]]. To complete this memory safely, it is advised to bring at least one friend who can either draw away the Dark Dargons from the player or help collect lost [[Winged Light]] if they have been hit. Another strategy could be to learn the Dark Dargons' routes and act accordingly, however, there are certain stretches where the player will be exposed and unprotected for a prolonged time, making it difficult to avoid the Dark Dragons.

As their memory unfolds, the Pleaful Parent can be seen chasing their companion [[Crabs|Crab]] through the Graveyard, occasionally hiding from the watchful eyes of the Dark Dragons. When they reach the far side of the area, the Spirit can be seen diving after the Crab and missing. They return back to the bonfire, where the Crab stands on top of the Pleaful Parent's head.

At the end of the memory, the companion Crab runs off as the Pleaful Parent puts their hands on their head in shock. The Spirit tries to run after the Crab, but it disappears into the dense green fog. The Pleaful Parent then drops to their knees and extends their left arm, as if they were pleading, "Don't go!".

The player then comes up behind the Pleaful Parent and rings a small bell; when the Pleaful Parent turns around and is surprised to see the player, the player is prompted to copy (and, thus, learn) the same pleaful expression.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar hold their hands to their chest and drop down to their knees with a dropped head, before raising it again and stretching their trembling left arm forward, while a prolonged dramatic violin sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a glowing blue trail of light following the motion of your avatar's left hand.
*Level 3 will make your avatar hold their hands to their chest and let themselves fall down to their knees with a dropped head, letting their arms go with the impact of the fall, after which their upper body drops forward once again, with their hands weakly supporting their weight on the ground, before stretching their trembling left arm forward, while a prolonged dramatic orchestra sound effect plays.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with a glowing blue trail of light following the motion of your avatar's left hand.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
