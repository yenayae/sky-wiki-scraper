==Ultimate Gifts==
The Season of Performance Guide offered 3 Ultimate Gifts, available to be purchased by [[Season Pass]] holders with [[Currency#Season Hearts|Seasonal Hearts]] during the Season of Performance only.

=== Performance Ultimate Mask===
The Performance Ultimate [[Mask]] is a grey mask with a long "beak". It has a big, yellow, bent "M" shape over it, the top spikes of the "M" shape transforming into long "feathers" that are slightly bent behind. Through the eyes goes a light grey line each, making the eye form appear more oval than round. Under the eyes, it has two yellow triangles. The Mask was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available for {{Cost|1 SH|season=Performance}} after unlocking the Friendship Tree's first node.<br>

===Mask===
The additional [[Mask]] is permanently available to purchase for {{Candle|42}} regular candles after completing the [[Season of Performance#Quest #2|second Quest]] from the Performance Guide's [[#Quest Tree|Quest Tree]].

On April 11 2022, TGC officially announced <ref name="Personality Tweet">https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1513683349017141249</ref> and introduced the {{PAGENAME}} with the following personality traits:

*'''The Performance Guide, the group’s director & biggest supporter.'''
*Twin of a past Season Guide
*Knows 50 tongue-twisters to use in warmups
*Can’t let go of that review from last year
*Writing a comedy but still figuring out punchlines

On February 27, 2023, after being asked "If Performance gang went on tour in an RV, who's driving?", Ash mentioned that "I would only entrust Modest Dancer or Performance Guide to be behind the wheel, I feel like Dancer would be the safest driver but would maybe be a bit anxious about driving a big RV :SkyLOL: So maybe Performance Guide"<ref>[https://discord.com/channels/575762611111592007/575827782144098304/1079837161249067130 Ash's Discord message about Performance Guide]</ref>.
