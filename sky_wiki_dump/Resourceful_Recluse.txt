== Memory ==
<!--<div>{{#ev:youtube|YoutubeID|200px|inline|Video Guide}}-->

The [[Resourceful Recluse]] can be found in [[The Last City]], tucked away from the other merchants in a quiet alley on the right side of the Marketplace. 

Unlike other Spirits, the Resourceful Recluse has no memory that can be relived, but rather a Seasonal Quest dedicated to them. With the Spirit's home in shambles, unable to build it back up all by themselves, players complete a series of tasks, helping the Spirit bring their home back to its full glory.

Players can interact with the Resourceful Recluse upon completion of the [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1#Quest #2|second Quest]].

==Cosmetics==

It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node ({{Cost|30 SC|season=Two Embers - Part 1}} total).<br>
