The Ushering Stargazer can be found by the [[Isle of Dawn#Sand Dunes|Sand Dunes]], behind a stone pillar between the [[Passage Stone]] and the large ramp with a [[Children of Light#Sand Dunes|Child of Light]] leading to the Isle of Dawn Temple. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 6 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Ushering Stargazer is seen traveling across the land together with another Spirit. The Ushering Stargazer spots a falling star streaking across the sky and rushes ahead while their friend lags behind. What lands is not a star but a small child - curled up and unconscious. Concerned, the Ushering Stargazer urges their slow companion to hurry up and come closer.

At the end of the memory, the two Spirits stand over the fallen child who begins to stir. The Ushering Stargazer and their friend give each other an uncertain glance, wondering what to do with their discovery.<br>
