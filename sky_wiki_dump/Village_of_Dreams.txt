==Overview==
<section begin="Village Overview"/>
The Village of Dreams is a cozy, snow-covered village nestled below the towering [[Coliseum]]. The area features many houses in the familiar Valley architecture with various tents scattered around. In the center of the area is a statue of a skater surrounded by an ice rink. Overlooking the entire area is the slopes, holding Gondolas which can transport the player up and down the slopes (after completion of [[Season of Dreams#Quest #2|Quest #2]]). It also holds the entrance to the [[Hermit Valley]] - however entry is impossible through flying due to the extreme winds. Therefore the Gondolas leading up to the Valley must be activated (via starting [[Season of Dreams#Quest #3|Quest #3]]). Additionally, the entrance to the [[Village Theater]] is found near the Social Space entrance, in the right side of the small neighborhood.

Near the Social Space entrance stands the [[Dreams Guide]], who leads the player through six quests - on a tale showing the inspirational journey of a young spirit. In the area surrounding the Guide are 4 Seasonal Spirits, which upon completing, will give you their unique [[Expression]].<section end="Village Overview"/>

|c1   = <div> [[File:Valley-HotSpring1.png|thumb|300x300px]]
The Hotspring, a once-social-light area, now is a secluded area holding one [[Treasure Candle]]. A sanctuary nestled amidst the snowy village, it can be found in the [[Valley of Triumph#Village of Dreams]], on the mountain near the [[Dreams Guide]]. From the entrance from the Social Area, fly forwards towards [[Children_of_Light#Village_of_Dreams_(3)|Valley's Wing Light #12]] and keep flying up. There will be a hidden spot within the mountain with steam, where the Hot Spring is. This location can occasionally be featured in a [[Quests#General_Quests_in_Valley|Daily Quest]]; {{Icon|Quest-icon.png}} Visit the Hotsprings in the Village of Dreams</div>
