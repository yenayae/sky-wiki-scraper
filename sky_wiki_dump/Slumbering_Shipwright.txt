The Slumbering Shipwright can be found in [[Prairie Villages]] on the larger middle island, behind a two-player door. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Slumbering Shipwright is seen moving throughout their workstation with a hammer in hand, dutifully repairing the broken boat half that sits at the center of the room.

At the end of the memory, the Spirit hammers away at the boat while starting to nod off, missing a few strikes as they nearly fall asleep standing up. A [[Butterflies|Butterfly]] perched on top of the boat flutters off, catching the Slumbering Shipwright's attention as it moves towards the nearby bed. The Spirit sleepily stumbles after it, stretching with a huge yawn before flopping down on their back to settle in for a rest.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar lean back as they stretch their arms to the side, lifting their right hand to cover their mouth, palm facing outwards, as if to hide a yawn.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a pale white "Z" flashing near their head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean back as they stretch their arms to the side, lifting their right hand to cover their mouth with a patting motion, palm facing outwards, before stretching both arms forward with their wrists crossed.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with light particles following your avatar's right hand and a pale white "Z" flashing near their head.

The prices of the three Expression upgrades are {{Cost|1 C}}, {{Cost|2 C}}, and {{Cost|2 C}}. Levels 3 and 4 are only available after unlocking the Spirit's [[Wing Buff]].

This difference extends to all Levels of the Expression.
