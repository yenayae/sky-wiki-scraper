== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|6t-gksA_AjE||inline|Video Guide}}

The Prophet of Water can be found in the [[Cave of Prophecies]], near the entrance to the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Water|Trial of Water]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 5-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].  

As their memory unfolds, the Prophet of Water can be seen educating a pair of younger Spirits about the history of the Cave. The Prophet of Water first greets the young Spirits before directing them to a seating area at the center of the Cave of Prophecies. Together, they sit with a larger group of Spirits listening intently to the lessons being provided by all four of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#All_Prophecy_Friendship_Trees|Prophets]]. The group then splits up as the Prophet of Water takes their two students aside, leading them towards the entrance of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Water|Trial of Water]] to continue the lesson. One of the younger Spirits slips and falls into a nearby pool of water during the teaching and the exasperated Prophet of Water helps them get back on their feet.

At the end of the memory, the Prophet of Water teaches the younger Spirits about patience by demonstrating how to breathe deeply and relax.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar lift up their hands to chest level and pat the air two times before taking a deep breath accented by lifting up their right hand with the breath, while a light metal wind chime sound effect plays; first in reverse on the inhale and then normally on the exhale.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a faintly glowing light around your avatar's head as they inhale.
*Level 3 will make your avatar assume a wide stance and take a very deep breath, accentuating their motion by slowly holding up their hands together over their head and then bringing them back down as they exhale, while a wooden wind chime sound effect plays; first in reverse on the inhale and then normally on the exhale.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a triple-layered golden glowing ring appearing around your avatar's head as they inhale, and a simple glowing blue circle as they exhale.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

==Trivia==
* Each [[Season_of_Prophecy#All_Prophecy_Friendship_Trees|Prophet]] is inspired by an animal and represented by an element of nature. The Prophet of Water is inspired by a sea turtle, wearing a sea turtle Cape and Mask. The "Deep Breath" Expression may also be based on sea turtles rising to the surface to take deep breaths when they run out of oxygen underwater.
