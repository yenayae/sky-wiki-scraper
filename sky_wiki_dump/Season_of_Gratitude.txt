The '''Season of Gratitude''' was the first season introduced to the Global Live version of the game on '''Friday, July 19, 2019 at 12:00 PDT (UTC -7)'''. It ended on '''Monday, September 2, 2019 at 12:00 PDT (UTC -7)''', lasting a total of '''45''' days. It was mostly a repeat of the [[Sky: Light Awaits|Light Awaits (Closed Beta)]] version of the [[Season of Gratitude (Spring 2019)|Spring Season of Gratitude]], with one additional Expression and some movement of the previous cosmetic items.

Seasonal Expressions were not intended to return to the game, so they were specialized Expressions particular to the Season's theme. The Season of Gratitude was introduced by TGC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew8GcHpGCLA in a livestream on Facebook] just prior to the first release of the season in April 2019 in beta.

== Trivia ==
* In January 2020, thatgamecompany added a new pack to the Store called [[Premium Candle Shop#Gratitude Fur Cape Pack|Gratitude Fur Cape Pack]]. The contents were similar to the Winter Musician Pack in that it contained two cosmetics and two music sheets from the Season of Gratitude that ran from July 19 to September 2, 2019. This pack cost $19.99 USD. The cosmetics were the white fur cape and bird mask from the Saluting Protector Spirit. This was later taken down when the [[Season of Rhythm]] was concluded.
* The 'White Fur Cape' from Saluting Protector was red during the Closed Beta of Sky. (Sky: Light Awaits)
* With the "Leap" expression, it is possible to leap over a crab while it is charging at you, as the character's hitbox will move along with the expression movement.
* The Season of Gratitude is depicted in several merch items from [[That Sky Shop]]. To know more about That Sky Shop products, visit their website: https://thatskyshop.com
