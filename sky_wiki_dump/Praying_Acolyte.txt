<br>
The Praying Acolyte can be found on the [[First Floor Vault|First Floor of Vault]], to the right of the lantern-powered elevator and behind the four-player door that requires the {{Emote|Telekinesis|inline_text}} Expression to open. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 5 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Praying Acolyte tends to various graves in the area, praying at some tombstones and placing candles at others. The Spirit's last stop is at the top of a ledge overlooking the field of graves.

At the end of the memory, the Praying Acolyte looks down upon the small graveyard from atop the ledge. They appear to be also admiring the star-like particles hovering above and press their hands together in respectful prayer.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar bow their head and press both hands together in front of their chest. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
*Level 2 will make the same motion as Level 1 with a white halo of light surrounding both hands.
*Level 3 will make your avatar raise their arms above their head before bringing them down to press together in front of their chest, head bowed deeply, and their Cape spread out like wings behind them. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
*Level 4 will make the same motion as Level 3 with a yellow glow surrounding both hands and light particles following their movements.

The prices of the three Expression upgrades are {{Cost|3 C}}, {{Cost|5 C}}, and {{Cost|7 C}}. Levels 3 and 4 are only available after unlocking the Spirit's [[Wing Buff]].
