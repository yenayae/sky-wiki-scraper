'''Friendship Tree''' is a general term in Sky for various menus used to "grow your friendship" -- either with [[Spirits]] or with [[Making Friends|other players]].  With Spirits, the "reward" for growing your friendship is that the Spirit will give you various [[collectibles]], i.e. it is how you purchase items from spirits, and therefore an alternative name for Friendship Trees is '''Spirit Shops'''.  The details of how to access Friendship Trees and what types of items are available depend upon the the specific type of tree:
* [[Friendship Tree (Regular)]]: The "standard" Friendship Tree / Spirit Shop used to obtain items from [[Regular Spirits]].
* [[Friendship Tree (Seasonal)]]: The Friendship Tree for [[Seasonal Spirits]] when their [[Seasonal Events|Season]] is active.
* [[Friendship Tree (Traveling)]]: The Friendship Tree for [[Traveling Spirits]], i.e. Seasonal Spirits that return after their season is over.
* [[Friendship Menu]]: The Friendship Tree seen when you click on a [[Making Friends|Friend]] (another player).
