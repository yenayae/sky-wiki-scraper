'''Days of Sunlight''' is an annual event celebrating the warmth of the summer season, encouraging players to kick back and relax under the sun. Days of Sunlight was first introduced in 2022 as the successor to [[Days of Summer]] before later returning the following year, where it was combined with [[Lazy Days]] to offer brand new and returning [[collectibles]] and activities.

During the two-week event, all Spirits from the [[Season of Assembly]] gather in [[Elevated Clearing]] (also known as "Sunny Forest") to enjoy the festivities together with players. The pond and surrounding area of Elevated Clearing gets a makeover, where all sorts of activities await:

*Help a group of baby [[Jellyfish]] venture into the open
*Make music with the Assembly Spirits
*Try your hand at fishing for [[Pieces of Light|Light]] in nearby waters

During the event, summer-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] are available from the in-game shop, and the Sunlight Guide Spirit offers various cosmetics from their Friendship Tree. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy Traveler's Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] and the pop-up mini Spell shop at Elevated Clearing.

Days of Sunlight returned for a fourth year! 
The event began on '''September 1, 2025 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended on '''September 22, 2025 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''''''<ref name="Sunlight2025_extended">Days of Sunlight 2025 was extended by [https://discord.com/channels/575762611111592007/628684058414678026/1416198171410829362 1 day] due to issues with completing Days of Sunlight quests .</ref>,'' lasting '''22''' days. For the duration of the event, the Sunlight Guide appeared at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to the [[Vault_of_Knowledge#The_Archives|The Archives]] in Vault of Knowledge.

Far away from it all, deep within the [[Vault of Knowledge]], the [[Spirits]] were hard at work, cataloguing scrolls and starlit tomes. They had heard whispers of Days of Sunlight but unfortunately, were far too busy to leave their post. But after the Sunlight Guide asked the Spirits to join them and enjoy the summer, they came up with a clever solution: If they can’t visit the beach, perhaps they can archive it!

During the first two weeks of the event, players could accept a [[Days of Sunlight#Photo Quests|Photo Quest]] from the [[Praying Acolyte]]. The camera would automatically equip, and players would be prompted to seek out and photograph something specific: an inviting beach chair, the golden sun, perhaps some fishing poles… These photographs would help create whimsical beach scenes inside the [[Vault]] itself—allowing for the Spirits to relax in the scenery players brought them.

During the final week, the Sunlight Guide stood in place of the Praying Acolyte, and prompted players with photographing the [[Aviary Village#Realm Entry Portals|Hidden Forest Realm Portal]], which they then used to transport the Vault of Knowledge [[Spirits]] to the summer-themed [[Elevated Clearing]]. After the various Vault Spirits had been pushed away to enjoy summer in the Forest, all Spirits from [[Season of Remembrance]] arrived to enjoy the archived beach for the rest of the event.{{Clear}}

===Ticket Locations===
[[file:Days-of-Sunlight-Ticket-Popsicle.png|125px|thumb|A Days of Sunlight popsicle Ticket]]

For the first two weeks of the event, players could earn {{Cost|3 T|event=sunlight}} Tickets by completing a quest with a Spirit. The Spirit would assign three survey points where players needed to photograph specific objects. Once completed, the objects were archived in Memory Lanterns and displayed on the beach, which expanded daily as new items were added.

After the [[Season of Remembrance]] Spirits arrived, players could earn the daily {{Cost|3 T|event=sunlight}} Tickets by taking three photos of anything in the event area.

Additionally, {{Cost|2 T|event=sunlight}} Tickets could be collected daily by gathering the blue Event Ticket Light scattered across the beach, throughout the event's duration.

A total of {{Cost|15 T|event=sunlight}} Bonus Tickets could be obtained by helping the [[Levitating Adept]] take photos of the three requested objects in any [[Realm]]. They could be collected at any time during the event.

Players could also buy additional Tickets (costing {{Cost|2 AC}} or {{Cost|6 C}} each) from the mini [[Spell Shop]] next to the Sunlight Guide at [[Vault_of_Knowledge#The_Archives|The Archives]].

====Photo Quests====
For the first two weeks, there was a unique [[Daily Quest]], which tasked players with taking three photos of an item, after which it would be added to the event area. 

The Sunlight Guide at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]] offered to take the player to the event area, where the [[Praying Acolyte]] waited. They would teleport the player to the Daily Quest's area, where they needed to stand in three designated photo spots and take a photo with the automatically equipped {{Spirit Item|Moments Guide|prop|inline_text}}—a white circle over the "lens" would mark that the item is in focus. After the photos had been taken, the player needed to return to the Spirit and teleport back to the event area. Here, the Praying Acolyte transfered the photos into a Memory Lantern, which the player needed to {{Icon|Icon flame.png}} light. The lantern flew up and the item would be added to the event area.

{{#ev:youtube|WhTwIDwisj8||right|Days of Sunlight 2024 Trailer}}
Days of Sunlight returned for a third year, offering an escape to a balmy corner of the [[Realms]] where players can make new memories with friends and [[Spirits]] alike! The event began on '''Monday, August 26, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended on '''Thursday, September 12, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)'''<ref name="Sunlight2024_extended">Days of Sunlight 2024 was extended by [https://discord.com/channels/575762611111592007/575768778789617674/1281047884292427828 4 days] due to server errors.</ref>, lasting 18 days. For the duration of the event, the Sunlight Guide appeared at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to the [[Elevated Clearing]] in Hidden Forest.

Clear streams, peaceful glades, and enchanting wildlife make the golden hillsides of the [[Hidden Forest]] the perfect place to beat the heat. Gather around a cozy campfire to relax and enjoy some toasty snacks for a bit of extra [[Pieces of Light|Light]] or to make music with the event Spirits. For players looking to make more of a splash, the Elevated Clearing is practically a playground with diving boards, waterslides, and more. Plus, if you look around, you might find some baby [[Jellyfish]] who could use some help to make their way through the world. 

All of the [[Season of Assembly#Spirits and Cosmetics|Assembly Spirits]] were out and about as the event unfolded, and no matter when you drop by, one of them were down for a friendly game of tag. Whether paddling and swimming or floating and lounging, players could take advantage of this opportunity to enjoy some fun under the sun.

It is said that the spell is from [https://sky.163.com/news/official/20240301/26689_1140769.html NetEase's Spring Camping Event], and it is not clear at this time whether it is an intended Easter egg or a bug.

==August 2022<span id="2022"></span>==
[[File:Days-of-Sunlight-promo-image-2022.jpg|thumb|Days of Sunlight 2022 Promo image]]
To celebrate the splendor of summer, a new event set foot in Sky: '''Days of Sunlight'''. This event replaced the previous year's [[Days of Summer]] and began on '''Monday, August 22, 2022 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended on '''Sunday, September 11, 2022 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)'''. For the duration of the event, the Sunlight Guide appeared in [[Home]], offering to take players directly to [[Elevated Clearing]].

For the occasion, Elevated Clearing got a makeover and featured several activities with visiting Spirits from [[Season of Assembly]], such as fishing, freeing [[Jellyfish]] with the [[Marching Adventurer]], playing music with the [[Scolding Student]], and roasting marshmallows over a campfire.
