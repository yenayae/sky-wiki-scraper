[[File:Piece-of-light.png|thumb|150px|One Piece of Light]]
'''Pieces of Light''' (also called '''Wax''') are orbs that players can collect to forge [[Currency#Candles|Candles]], one of the main currencies in Sky. They are primarily collected by lighting red Candles or burning [[Darkness|Darkness Plants]] found throughout the [[Realms]]. This page documents sources of Light with permanent locations and precise Light counts. Other sources of Light that are variable, for a limited-time, or involve randomization are documented at [[Additional Light Sources]].

Usually, Light appears as red fire orbs, floating above Candles that are lit or in a location where Darkness has been burned. Blue orbs may appear instead when Darkness is burned near water or when spawned by water-specific Light sources (clams, fish, etc.). Blue and red fire orbs are equivalent and functionally the same.

When a player approaches these Pieces of Light, the Light will fly into their bodies and fill up the Candle meter displayed in the top left corner of the screen. When it is fully filled, the player can click on the meter to forge a Candle, adding it to their total count. Un-claimed Candles continue to stack until they are forged, so players can choose whether they wish to forge them one-by-one or all at once.

Every day at 00:00 midnight Pacific Time (PST/PDT), all Light sources reset. Not all Darkness Plants are available every day, as certain Darkness only appear every other day. In [[Golden Wasteland]] (but not in any other Realm), all Darkness Plants are available on Sundays.<br>

== Light Sources ==
There are several ways to collect Light.Â Some areas can contain their unique Light sources, such as the Small Clams in [[Treasure Reef]] or the Flower Bouquets in [[Village Theater]], but those are documented in the [[Additional Light Sources]] page.

These are some Light sources, each with an estimate of how many Pieces of Light they give:<br>

+ These subtotals do not include the additional Pieces of Light from random daily Flower Bouquets in [[Village Theater]] and Small Clams in [[Treasure Reef]]. Estimates for those are listed separately in the table  labelled "Inconsistent Sources of Light".

With the new [[Daily Light]] system, players are able to collect approximately '''20''' Candles per day. (Note: Light is still stored in your inventory, even if it is not forged.)

Information on this page and the [[Additional Light Sources]] page were gathered by numerous editors throughout the years ({{Userlinks|Chiychiy}}, {{Userlinks|Omicron23}}, {{Userlinks|Jet Lye}}, {{Userlinks|Numaner}}, {{Userlinks|Ray808080}}, {{Userlinks|Ghostingskies}}, etc). Special thanks to '''lonelyste''' on Discord for the initial candle count data in 2021 and the detailed verification of several under-documented sections in 2024, '''galerowfylery''' on Discord for providing data on many variable Light sources, and '''pingubot''' on Discord for collecting the Sliding and Flying Race fragment count.

==[[Eye of Eden|Eye of Eden (Spoilers!)]]<span id="Eden"><span id="Eye of Eden"></span></span> ==
On the road to the point of no return, there are occasionally Pieces of Light scattered along the path, in the spots where the small red radiant shards are located. Although it has been speculated that this phenomenon is tied to [[Shard Eruptions#Strong Eruptions|Strong Shard Eruptions]], these Pieces of Light have been observed to also appear on days with no Eruptions. While this appears to be a bug, further investigation is required to find out what exactly triggers this to occur and how much Light can be collected.

===Orbit===
There are two flying sections before entering Orbit: with all the floating [[Ancestor Spirits]] the player has collected and with a random selection of friends and favorite friends. 

In the first section, the player receives 5 Pieces of Light for each Ancestor Spirit they fly into. In the second section, the player receives 5 Pieces of Light for each favorite friend they fly into. The chains of Sky Kids holding hands do not give Pieces of Light, even though they will [[Deep Call]] when flown into.<br>

== Additional Light Sources ==
Additional Light sources from Holiday Events, Social Light areas, and have randomization can be found on the [[Additional Light Sources]] page.
