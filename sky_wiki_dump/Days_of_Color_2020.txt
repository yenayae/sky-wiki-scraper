The [[Spells#Rainbow_Spell|Rainbow Spell]] was introduced during Days of Rainbow 2020. Each year during the event, multiple free copies of this [[Spell]] are available from the [[Spell Shop]] (either at [[Forgotten Ark]] or the [[Sleepy Traveling Merchant]]). These free Spells are in addition to the for-purchase Rainbow Spells that are always available (Friday-Sunday) from the [[Scroll Shop]].

==Trivia==
*Days of Rainbow 2020 was not available in the [[NetEase|Chinese version]] of ''Sky'': instead, the Days of Dragon Boat took its place. In 2021, Days of Rainbow was introduced in the Chinese version of ''Sky'', renamed 缤纷飞行日 (roughly translates to "Colorful Flight Day"), from November 18 to December 1, 2021. The Chinese version does not include the [[#Rainbow Pack|Rainbow Pack]] IAP.
