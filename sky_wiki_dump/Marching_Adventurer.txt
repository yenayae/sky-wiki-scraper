<section begin="Summary" />The '''Marching Adventurer''' is a [[Seasonal Spirit]] from the [[Season of Assembly]] who offers the {{Emote|Marching Adventurer|inline_text}} Expression. The Marching Adventurer is found in the [[Forest's Brook]], on top of a hill across from the sheltered house inside a hill on the player's left when first entering the area. The collectibles [[#Traveling Spirit|offered]] by this Spirit are a {{Spirit Item|Marching Adventurer|Mask|inline_text}}, a {{Spirit Item|Marching Adventurer|Hair|inline_text}}, and a {{Spirit Item|Marching Adventurer|Prop|label=Torch Prop|inline_text}}.<section end="Summary" />

== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|CC2oKWB_gu8||inline|Video Guide}}

The Marching Adventurer can be found in [[Forest's Brook]], atop a hill and directly across from the gazebo where the [[Blushing Prospector]] can be found. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

Note that some fragments are exposed to the [[Spirit Health|polluted rain]], so be quick to collect them.

As their memory unfolds, the Marching Adventurer and the [[Scaredy Cadet]] can be seen walking along the hills above the brook. The Marching Adventurer spots a stick that looks just right, and continues to carry it throughout the rest of the memory. The Adventurer and the Cadet soon come across a large, fallen log connecting two hills like a bridge. The Adventurer decides to march across the log, but the Cadet is frightened by the idea of walking across the log and soon finds a quicker, alternative route to cross the gap between the two hills. The Adventurer and the Cadet meet up again towards the end of the memory.

At the end of the memory, the Adventurer finds the Cadet on a ledge a little higher up. The Cadet joins the Adventurer on the lower level, and the Marching Adventurer shows the Cadet how to march in time and with confidence, keeping their eyes forward.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar march in place, arms swinging to chest level and legs lifting energetically with each step, while a steady drumbeat plays in rhythm with the steps. The action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with white trails of light following the motion of your avatar's hands and white starburst effects bursting from their feet each time they touch the ground again.
*Level 3 will make your avatar leap up into the air before marching with their arms held closer to their torso and their legs brought up quicker while a fast drumbeat plays. After every fourth step your avatar will jump up again. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with green trails of light following the motion of your avatar's hands.

As a Returning Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
