From '''Monday, July 29, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' through '''Sunday, August 18, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', players could join a rotating series of [[#The Games|games]] that had them running, leaping, soaring, and even scampering through some of the best-known places in ''Sky''! For the duration of the event, the Crab of Triumph appeared in [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to a special version of the [[Valley of Triumph#Coliseum|Coliseum]].

Each day until the day of the closing ceremony, players could take part in two different games to enjoy some lighthearted and friendly competition with fellow Sky Kids. Complete games to score points for your assigned team and earn event currency—along with some extra [[Pieces of Light|Light]] to reward your efforts. On the final day on August 18, fly to the closing ceremony in the Coliseum to celebrate the winning team under the thunderous roars of the crowds.<section end="Summary" />

===New Spells===
====Team Cape Spells====
The Team Cape Spells temporarily gave players a [[Cape]] representing their assigned event team for 30 minutes. There were four different versions available, each featuring a different color and [[Constellations|Realm Constellation]] symbol: yellow with [[Daylight Prairie]]'s pot, blue with [[Hidden Forest]]'s hammer and anvil, red with [[Valley of Triumph]]'s ball and paddles, and green with [[Golden Wasteland]]'s shield and spear. These [[Spells]] were introduced in 2024 and are not collectible; they were only available upon teleporting to the event area from [[Home]] or [[Aviary Village#Aviary Event Store|Aviary Village]]. Additionally, players were unable to pick and choose which version of the Team Cape Spells they would like to obtain, as they could only access the one that represents their randomly assigned team. ''Note that these Capes were only available as a Spell.''<br>

===The Games===
<div>{{#ev:youtubeplaylist|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_CZ24gXpCk&list=PLl2dLrx-duQgedEYgPBHeLmbCV-ZooBo5||right|All Tournament Games Playlist}}
Each day until the closing ceremony on August 18, players could take part in a rotating set of games that offered some lighthearted and friendly competition with fellow Sky Kids. These games tasked players with completing races and collecting fragments of light in various locations within the [[Realms]] while under unique conditions, such as having a limited amount of [[Winged Light#Leveling Up Capes|Cape Energy]] or a transformation into a [[Dark Crab]]. To begin a game, players visited the [[Coliseum]] and had to sit at either of the two available meditation circles near the scoreboard pillar in front of the entrance to the [[Valley Temple]]. 

Players could score up to 3 points per game for their assigned team each day to boost their team's position on the scoreboard. The daily team points were determined by what place was earned for the game (1 point for bronze, 2 points for silver, and 3 points for gold). Players could replay the games to maximize the number of daily points earned for their team. By participating in these games, players could also earn [[#Ticket Locations|Tickets]] to exchange for themed IGC (in-game currency) items and a bit of extra [[Pieces of Light|Light]] as a reward for their efforts.

==Trivia==
*Capeless players did not get transformed into [[Days of Mischief#Crab Curse Spell|Dark Crabs]] during the [[#Crab Race|Crab Race]].
*During [[Sky Beta|Beta]] testing, the Crab of Triumph NPC was initially called the "Crab of Competition" before being renamed.
*During [[Sky Beta|Beta]] testing, participates received a stone crab trophy and the final winning team received a golden crab trophy. This was removed for Live as the trophies were not in line with what the devs had in mind for the event<ref>[https://discord.com/channels/575762611111592007/583370574449999880/1267885828022206597 Chaotic Raccoon said in a Discord message]: "The trophies were not really in line with what the team had in mind for the event so they were removed for live. That is why the communications are not mentioning them. Sometimes there are some BETA elements that don't make it to live. At least you got to have a nest crab for a bit!"</ref>.
