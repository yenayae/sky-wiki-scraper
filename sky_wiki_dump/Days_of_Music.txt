The Fledgling Upright Piano consists of a gray upright piano with blue accents and which is marked with the {{Season Icon|Belonging|inline_text}} symbol, and a stone stool with a blue cushion. Unlike most other [[Instruments]], this item also functions as a placeable [[Prop]] that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]]. The player must first place down the item, then sit on the stool to play. This Prop was introduced in 2024 and is available for {{Cost|4.99 USD|refnote}} from the front desk in [[Harmony Hall]]. Although this Prop first appeared as part of the Days of Music event, it remains permanently available in the game.<br>

====Jam Station====
<section begin="jam-station" />The Jam Station is a gray rectangular sequencer cut into four segments, with a blue cloth framing the front, and blue paint on the front and back. The segments are also decorated with colored diamonds, some of which are lit differently between them. Each section uses different [[Instruments]] based on the four [[Music Sheet Parts]]: the purple section uses '''Melody''', the red section uses '''Bass''', the blue section uses '''Percussion''', and the yellow section uses '''Wind'''. It allows editing of each of these parts independently, and always loops. To use it, players must stand anywhere behind the [[Prop]], then interact with a in-use Instrument's icon. While using the Prop, the player's avatar sways side to side in-place, and when a note is selected, the avatar uses their hands to press on the Jam Station. It is a placeable Prop that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]]. When carried on its owner's back, it appears as a single simplified segment. 

This [[Prop]] was introduced in 2024 and is available for {{Cost|250 C}} from the Harmony Hall Guide at [[Harmony Hall]]. Although this Prop first appeared as part of the Days of Music event, it remains permanently available in the game. The Jam Station is also permanently available for use on the second floor of [[Harmony Hall#Second Floor|Harmony Hall]], in the Painting Workshop. An unobtainable special version is available on the [[Office]] rooftop during the [[Sky Anniversary]] event only.<br>
