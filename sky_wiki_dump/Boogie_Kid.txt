== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|X2FUMSK0ZLs||inline|Video Guide}}

The Boogie Kid is found in [[Isle of Dawn]], in a cloud island containing a butterfly filled cave, located to the right of the temple. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 4 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

Players use the set of two switches to open the grate. Then, they can fly up to an elevated switch on the right to bring down a moving platform on the other side of the cave. This leads players down a hallway to another set of switches to unlock a sealed butterfly jar. Once the seal is burned, the butterflies flutter to the center of the room where the Spirit once stood. A [[Deep Call]] amongst the butterflies causes them to lift the player up and through the hole in the ceiling.  

As their memory unfolds, the Boogie Kid can be seen opening their arms wide, looking up at the stream of light coming from the hole above, before running towards a tunnel which leads to the top of the island in the clouds. Across the small lake at the top of the island, the Boogie Kid looks up, with arms wide open, at the swarm of butterflies dancing about.

At the end of the memory, the Boogie Kid does a little dance in place with their arms loosely lifted up at their sides. The player steps closer, grabs a bell from underneath their cape and rings it, causing the Boogie Kid to stop. They bring their hand to their chin and think for a short while, before they raise up their arm in epiphany, with a glowing exclamation mark blinking above their head.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar bring up their arms in front of their chest and sway slightly from side to side in-place, while rhythmic bongo sounds plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a glowing burst of sparkles rotating around your avatar's hands.
*Level 3 will make your avatar energetically step from side to side with their arms held up, while faster bongo sounds play. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with a wider glowing burst of sparkles rotating around your avatar's hands.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
