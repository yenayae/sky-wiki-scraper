'''Instruments''' are [[Cosmetics]] that players can use to play [[Music]]. As with all cosmetics, purchasing Instruments is not a requirement to progress in the game, but it is a way for players to express themselves and interact with other players. More so than other cosmetics, Instruments significantly enrich the ''Sky'' experience by enabling a range of new activities. You can play music solo or with friends, whether playing music freeform or using a [[Music Sheet]].

Multiple Instruments are available in game. Although the mechanics are the same for all Instruments, your Instrument selection has multiple implications:
* How many [[#Instrument Notes|notes]] you can play. Most Instruments have 15 notes, but percussion Instruments only have 8. Only a single Instrument has 4 notes.
* The pitch of the notes. Some Instruments play at higher or lower octaves than others.
* The tone / quality of the notes varies to reflect real life variations between Instrument sounds.
* Which [[Music Sheet Parts|parts]] you play when using a [[Music Sheet]]: each Instrument only plays one of the four available parts.
* Whether you can move after equipping an Instrument: you can only move around with Instruments that are played in a standing stance. (Note that this is only possible on devices with touchscreen controls, as well as on PC by remapping button inputs.)

Note that some Instruments are unable to be practiced in the [[Harmony Hall#Rehearsal Room|Harmony Hall Rehearsal Room]]:

* The [[Dark Horn]] is not considered an Instrument since you cannot play Music Sheets with it, and you cannot practice with it in the said room.
* Despite being considered Instruments, you still cannot practice with any of [[The Musicians' Legacy#Instrument|Grand]] [[Duets Guide#Ultimate Gifts|Pianos]] or the [[Days_of_Music#Fledgling_Upright_Piano|Fledgling Upright Piano]] in there due to them being considered [[Props#Small Placeable Props Display|small props]] as well.
* The [[Days_of_Music#Jam_Station|Jam Station]], while still being considered an Instrument, you cannot practice in there as it lacks the ability of play Music Sheets.

== How to Play Music ==
To play an Instrument, you must first equip it by selecting it in the Props [[Outfit Shrine]]; your currently equipped Instrument is visible on your back. To play the Instrument, open the [[Expression Menu]]. An icon for your Instrument is added in the row of actions, next to the "Home" icon (typically the third row of icons). Selecting that icon makes you take out the Instrument and be ready to play.

An alternative but temporary way to equip an Instrument is to select one of the demonstration Instruments on display in [[Harmony Hall]]. Such Instruments are immediately equipped and ready to play. When you close the music screen, the Instrument is returned to the display.

The main music screen is a set of 15 (or 8 for percussion Instruments) symbols representing the notes you can play; see [[#Instrument Notes|Instrument Notes]] for details. There are two main options for how to play music:
* Freeform, by clicking on music notes. Many [[Sky Music Guide|guides and tools]] exist to help you play freeform music.
* Using [[Music Sheets]] that show you to how to play songs, by highlighting which notes you should play. More details are provided on the [[Music Sheets]] article.

== Instrument Notes ==
[[File:A Guide to Music in Sky-Introduction to music in Sky|thumb|right|300px|Video guide to music in sky. Image shows the 15 notes in C Major.]]
Most of the Instruments in the game have '''15 notes''', which span two octaves of a major scale. The lowest pitch note is in the upper left, and pitch increases to the right, then down. The most common scale used in the game is C Major, in which case the notes in the top row (from left to right) are C, D, E, F, and G. The second row has A, B, C, D, and E (where C, D, E are an octave higher than the first row). The third row is F, G, A, B, C (all at a higher octave).

[[File:Sky pitch range EN.png|thumb|right|300px|The pitch ranges of all non-percussion Instruments in Sky]]
The notes played are the same for all Instruments (other than percussion), but the '''pitch''' of the notes -- the specific octave of the first C for example -- varies depending upon your selected Instrument.
* The standard [[Piano]] is in the "typical" range, which in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation scientific pitch notation] is summarized as C<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>6</sub>. The [[Grand Piano]], the [[Kalimba]], the [[Triumph Violin]], the [[Voice of AURORA]], and most wind instruments ([[Bugle]], [[Flute]], [[Panflute]], and [[Vessel Flute]]) are also in this range.
* One octave higher: the [[Winter Piano]] and [[Xylophone]] are one octave higher than the piano, i.e., C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>7</sub>.
* One octave lower: the [[Triumph Saxophone]] and most of the string instruments ([[Electric Guitar]], [[Guitar]], [[Harp]], [[Lute]], and [[Ukulele]]) are one octave lower than the piano, i.e., C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>.
* Two octaves lower: the [[Horn]] and [[Cello]] are two octaves lower than the piano, i.e., C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>.
* Three octaves lower: The [[Contrabass]]' range is C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>.

Percussion Instruments are the only Instruments to have '''8 notes''' (with one notable exception having only 4) -- which in some case are not even pitched notes. Their sounds are handled differently than all the other Instruments, and even vary from one percussion Instrument to another. The drums ({{Instrument|Drum|inline_text}}, {{Instrument|Prophecy Drum|inline_text}}, and {{Instrument|Fortune Drum|inline_text}}) have unpitched sounds that do not correspond to musical notes. The bells ({{Instrument|Small Bell|inline_text}} and {{Instrument|Large Bell|inline_text}}) play the notes C<sub>4</sub>D<sub>4</sub>G<sub>4</sub>A<sub>4</sub>C<sub>4</sub>D<sub>4</sub>G<sub>4</sub>A<sub>4</sub>. The handpans ({{Instrument|Sanctuary Handpan|inline_text}} and {{Instrument|Triumph Handpan|inline_text}}) play the notes D<sub>3</sub>A<sub>3</sub>C<sub>4</sub>D<sub>4</sub>F<sub>4</sub>G<sub>4</sub>A<sub>4</sub>C<sub>5</sub>. Each Instrument's article provides additional details.

The discussion up until now provided the notes specifically used when playing in the '''key''' of C major. This is the most common key found in Sky, but many other keys are possible, and your Instrument's key will adjust automatically to match the key used by the background music of the current [[Realm]] or to match the key of the selected [[Music Sheet]]. More details about how to control the key are provided at [[Music Key]]. For most Instruments, all other keys are higher pitched than C major, with B major having the highest pitch overall. So while the Piano ranges from C<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>6</sub> in C major, it ranges from B<sub>4</sub> to B<sub>6</sub> in B major. However, for the bells and handpans, G major has the lowest and F‚ôØ/G‚ô≠ major has the highest pitch overall; for the Voice of AURORA, D‚ôØ/E‚ô≠ major has the lowest and D major has the highest pitch overall.

Instruments that have the fermata symbol ùÑê (the {{Instrument|Electric Guitar|inline_text}},  {{Instrument|Voice of AURORA|inline_text}}, {{Instrument|Triumph Violin|inline_text}}, {{Instrument|Triumph Saxophone|inline_text}}, {{Instrument|Cello|inline_text}}, {{Instrument|Harmonica|inline_text}}) indicate that the Instrument's notes can be held down to play an extended note.
