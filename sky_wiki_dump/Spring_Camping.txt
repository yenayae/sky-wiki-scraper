<section begin="Summary" />Fancy a relaxing little camping getaway? From '''Monday, March 4, 2024 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' until '''Sunday, March 10, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', join Spirits from the [[Season of Assembly]] for a short '''Spring Camping''' trip in Daylight Prairie above the [[Daylight Prairie#Eight-Player Puzzle Area|eight-player door]] to see them and make a campsite of your own! For the duration of the event, [[Scaredy Cadet]] appears in [[Aviary Village]], offering to teleport players directly to the campsite.

During their week-long camping trip, the Assembly crew will bring a fire that shares [[Social Light]] with everyone<!--include wax limit of bonfire; potentially 500?-->, as well as a special [[Shared Spaces|Shared Spaces Shrine]] that encompasses the entirety of the area and offers a range of items for everyone to use—including a couple of new [[Props]] that could build something a little sturdier than just a tent. Head over with friends or find new ones there, and you might also catch a glimpse of a [[Daylight_Prairie#Oreo|mysterious creature]] who sometimes can be spotted in the area, too.<section end="Summary" />

Speaking of Spirits who will be paying a special visit—for two weeks from '''Monday, March 4, 2024 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' until '''Sunday, March 17, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', four [[Returning Spirits#March 4, 2024|Returning Spirits]] from past Seasons: [[Indifferent Alchemist]], [[Nodding Muralist]], [[Ceasing Commodore]], and [[Frantic Stagehand]] are also heading to the area in Daylight Prairie above the [[Daylight Prairie#Eight-Player Puzzle Area|eight-player door]] where the Spring Camping will be. For the duration of their visit, Frantic Stagehand appears in [[Aviary Village]], offering to teleport players directly to the Returning Spirits at the Eight-Player Puzzle Area.

Similar to [[Traveling Spirits]], their Friendship Trees include items they originally brought when they were introduced as Seasonal Spirits, so you can choose to unlock the items you're interested in using [[Heart]]s, [[Currency#Candles|Candles]], or [[Ascended Candle]]s. So while you're in Daylight Prairie, head over to say hello to the group, snap a photo with everyone, or perhaps pick up an item you'd been hoping to find!
