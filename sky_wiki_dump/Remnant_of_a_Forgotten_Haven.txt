==Season Friendship Tree==
This [[Friendship Tree (Seasonal)|Friendship Tree]] provides the [[collectibles]] sold by this [[Season of Revival#Shops_&_Cosmetics|Shop]] during the [[Season of Revival]]. This Tree can no longer be accessed. However, the items listed here will be available for purchase when the Shop returns as a [[Traveling Spirit]] - or in some other form.

It is currently unknown how these items will return after the Season of Revival has ended. Because the Remnant of a Forgotten Haven was not a Seasonal Spirit, either the Traveling Spirit system would have to be modified to allow for non-Spirits, or else thatgamecompany will have to introduce another mechanism for obtaining past-Season cosmetics.
