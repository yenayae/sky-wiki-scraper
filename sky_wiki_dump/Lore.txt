== The Sky Children ==
{{main|Sky Children}}

Sky Children are beings born from light, and are the main characters in ''Sky: Children of the Light''. They are the "new generation" and are tasked with bringing light to the fallen Spirits.

They hold a flame inside their chest. When they bring their candle out, this inner light disappears. Light is the source of the Sky Child's power, and the more light the cape has, the higher it can fly.<ref name="TGC Interview">[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EY_T5k_c__D_ZoJFgQ0A4xsDIABW3gGhk1T2GSovZng/edit 2019 thatgamecompany official Japanese livestream transcript translated to English]</ref>

==The World of Sky==
Each realm represents a stage in multiple cyclical themes. The realms depict the times of day (sunrise, daytime, noon, sunset, evening, and night), the phases of life (childhood, adolescence, adulthood, mid-life, old age, and death), and the stages of civilization (exploration, birth, rise, prosper, and fall).<ref>The original development names for the realms were Dawn, Day, Rain, Sunset, Dusk, and Night. See the [[Seven Days of Sky]] page for more information.</ref> Spirits fit with the theme of the realm they appear in.<ref name="TGC Interview"/>

==Ancestor Spirits ==
{{main|Ancestors}}
[[File:Ascended-spirits-in-orbit.png|thumb|200px|Ascended Spirits in Orbit]]
<br>
The Ancestor Spirits are the previous inhabitants of the world of Sky. They each contain a memory that helps the Sky Child express themselves.

Spirits ascend like Sky Children do, through the final Orbit area of the game. They can briefly return to the world of Sky, however, in the form of Traveling Spirits. Recently, some Spirits have settled in Aviary Village.

== Winged Light==
{{main|Winged Light}}

Winged Lights or Children of Light are figures made of light, scattered throughout the Kingdom. They are static and usually gaze up towards the sky, except for a few found near the end of Eden where they are seen sitting down. There is also a [[Season of Shattering#Quest #6|Red Shard Memory]] where two Winged Light figures can be found hugging each other, although collecting this Winged Light counts as one. When a Sky Child collects a Winged Light, they gain extra Cape level from it, allowing them to fly higher as they gain Cape Wedges at certain Levels. 

Winged Lights can be seen from far away by a four-pointed circular light flare similar to a phenomena called a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog Sun Dog]. This is the same light flare that can be seen surrounding the top of the Eye of Eden in the distance of most realms. Winged Light is represented either by a star or as a star with wings in most murals and illustrations and when it is dropped by a Sky Child.

== Elders==
{{main|Elders}}

[[Elders]] are ancient beings, whose age and gender is unknown. Each [[Elders|Elder]] represents their realm and impressions of adults from the people of the phases of life in the corresponding region.

The Elder Masks are related to the theme of the realm and their abilities. The Isle Elder has a boat-shaped mask, the Prairie Elder has a pot-shaped mask, the Forest Elder has a diamond-shaped mask, the Valley Elders have comfortable athletic masks, the Wasteland Elder has an armored mask, and the Vault Elder's mask looks like a stone tablet.

The Valley Elders were not one entity divided into two and twins from the beginning. The sticks they have are similar to bats used in an ancient game.<ref name="TGC Interview" />

The Elders were Elders from the beginning, and the Sky Children are not directly related to them. The lights falling from the sky in the Aviary intro cutscene are the Elders, and they come from the same origin.<ref name="TGC Interview" />

The Elders are not in the temple when the Sky Children see them in the Elder Cutscenes. They are in a place beyond space and time.<ref name="TGC Interview" />

Each elder (plus the king & prince), have names based off Hebrew letters from concept development that are no longer canon. You can find the names of each elder [[Elders#Trivia|here]].

==Shattering Poems==
During the [[Season of Shattering]], TGC released many poems that reveal more of the lore of Sky on Discord, Twitter, and the official Sky News Blog. These poems directly relate to the [[Season of Shattering#Spirit Memory Quests|Ancient Memory]] associated with them. 

===Introduction Poem===
''The wounds of the past are never far from sight.''

''The light around us is in constant motion. Who could not see it? Who could not feel the joy of its movement?''

''Once, we guided the migrating flocks. Once, behemoths flew alongside us in peace. And then we took the light from the wind. The behemoths that remained were only the monuments to ourselves. Our cities shone with a captive glow. We were enraptured as we taught our machines to bind and hoard.''

''The world of the present can be healed, but our past cannot be undone. Jagged remnants lie in our wake, and even for the mountain it is too much to hold.''<ref>https://www.thatskygame.com/news/shards-of-the-past-arrive-in-season-of-shattering</ref>

===Jellyfish Poem===
{{Quote|''The light that swirled here was not warm<br>These were no drifting currents<br>Songs lost to the void<br>Bewildered in final moments of stillness''|[https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1547370314161602561 Jellyfish Poem, TGC Tweet]}}

===Crab/Darkness Poem ===
{{Quote|''Entranced by strange brilliance<br>And swept into its snare<br>A familiar glow that hid<br>Nothingness in its wake''|[https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1549499361276706816 Dark Crab Poem, TGC Tweet]}}

=== Manta Poem===
{{Quote|''Soft wings flowing to bright beacons<br>Drawn from the path, trusting until too late<br>Bound in a merciless harness<br>Soft wings despairing against stone''|[https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1555629778316808195 Manta Poem, TGC Tweet]}}

===Dark Dragon Poem===
{{Quote|''Ascending towards darkness<br>A distorted reflection<br>The hunter relentless to sate<br>Insatiable hunger''|2=[https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1561790361680461824 Dark Dragon Poem, TGC Tweet]}}

===Whale Poem===
{{Quote|''The distant call beyond reach<br>Echoes swallowed in a scouring silence<br>Empty light scattering the fragments<br>Of a spirit sundered in the break''|[https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1565812085715599360 Whale Poem, TGC Tweet]}}

===Elder Poem===
{{Quote|''Bare at the precipice<br>Unseen fractures crumble in the chasm<br>The stars under fathomless weight<br>Reaching to light and to dark<br>Carrying memory of all that was held<br>In the final moment of shattering''|[https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1572299615797653505 Elder Poem, TGC Tweet]}}

==Miscellaneous Lore ==

===Revival Blog Post===
''In a forgotten corner of the kingdom stand the ruins of Aviary Village, a town that once flourished. Now, the time has come to bring it back to life! Join the Season of Revival to rebuild a new area steeped in Skyâ€™s history, and transform it into a thriving town center once again for Spirits and Sky children alike.''<ref>https://www.thatskygame.com/news/build-together-with-season-of-revival</ref>
