==Overview==
The Concert Hall is a large, circular cave with a stage and interior canal. To enter the Hall, players ride a boat through a tunnel. The main room contains the stage, and is decorated with wall hangings, chat tables for concert-goers, a large skylight, and shining spotlights. Backstage, players can find ''non-interactable'' versions of the Seasonal Entities [[The Pianist's Beginnings]], [[The Cellist's Beginnings]], [[The Musicians' Legacy]], [[The Cellist's Flourishing]], and [[The Pianist's Flourishing]]. Further backstage is the dressing room, with the [[Compassionate Cellist]] and [[Duets Guide]], an [[Cosmetics#Outfit_Shrines|Outfit Shrine]], and an alternate entrance between the Concert Hall and Aviary Village (by the Realm Portals).

===Spotlight Tech===
Introduced in Patch {{v|0.28.5}}, Spotlight Tech allows players to share their music with each other on the [[Concert Hall]]'s grand piano. The area can hold up to 300 players through the [[Festival Tech]] feature.

To perform on stage, the player may select the {{Icon|Perform-on-stage-icon.png}} music note icon (found beside the {{Icon|Festival-tech-emote-Ray.png}} Festival Tech Emote icon) to join the queue. To remove themselves from the queue, players may select the {{Icon|Hourglass-icon.png}} hourglass icon. When it is a player's turn to perform, they will be teleported to the piano. Performing uses the standard music interface, where players can can access [[Music Sheets]]. The performer will have approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds, but can end their performance earlier by selecting the square-shaped stop icon. At the end, a pop-up will appear with the number of other players who listened to the performer's music!<br><small>Spotlight Tech is available to all players who have completed the [[Season_of_Duets#Quest_#2|Quest #2]] from the Season of Duets.</small>
