The Season of Dreams succeeded the [[Season of Prophecy]] and preceded by the [[Season of Assembly]].

==Welcome==

{{Quote|<br/>'''''It takes a village to reach a dream'''''}}
The Season of Dreams took players through the journey of a young spirit who dreams of performing in the Valley of Triumph’s Coliseum. Enter the humble new Village of Dreams and perilous Hermit Valley in [[Valley of Triumph]] and follow the tale of the young skater. Similar to the previous season, there were 4 Mentors/Spirits, each challenging you and the young skater with unique quests that will test your performance skills.

A number of changes have been introduced with this season:

*Similar to the previous two seasons, all spirits and activities were centered in Village of Dreams.
*Completing Seasonal Quests involved reliving a spirit

==The Village of Dreams==
{{Quote|<br/>'''''A new spark inspires a humble community'''''|Village of Dreams Opening}}
This season bought with it a wholly new area in The [[Valley of Triumph]] called the [[Village of Dreams]]. To visit the Village of Dreams, enter through either: A tunnel found in [[Valley of Triumph#Social Space and Slide|Valley's Social Space]], or through a gate located in the [[Coliseum]]. Both entry points are blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring one [[Golden Wasteland]] Spirit. Just like previous seasons, all of the quests, activities, and Spirits are found in this area. The Village of Dreams takes you through the journey of training a young skater.

==Hermit Valley==
{{Quote|<br/>'''''Home of the giant with a gentle heart'''''|Hermit Valley Opening}}
This Season also brought along the Hermit Valley, the home to the Hermit. The Valley can be found high above the Village of Dreams, and can only be entered via a Gondola from the Village itself. To enter, you must first start the 3rd Seasonal Quest from the Dreams Guide, which activates a new button for players to interact with at the very top of the Village slope. Lighting the button will unlock a Gondola leading up to the Hermit Valley. There is only one Spirit to be found here; the young skater, which is part of the 3rd Seasonal Quest.

==Daily Quests and Seasonal Candles==
===Daily Quests===
Collect Seasonal Candles throughout the Season to trade with the new Spirits for their Cosmetics.

At [[Home]], the Dreams Guide offered players four [[Quests|Daily Quests]] to complete every day. Players earned one Seasonal Candle per quest completed. Each day the Quest Giver stood next to a Realm's Portal, indicating where the day's Daily Quests may be completed. The chosen Realm also contained four bunches of Seasonal Candles. If players gathered the light from all four bunches, they were able to forge one extra Seasonal Candle. Players who had the Adventure Pass could also claim a Seasonal Candle at Home as a free daily bonus.

==Spirit Memory Quests==
Find the 'Dreams Guide' near the Lodge in between the 2 ice rinks. The Guide offers you special Seasonal Quests that show you the young skater's training journey. These quests are similar to reliving regular spirits, however, each quest put its own spin on it.

The Fourth Spirit Memory is found in the Coliseum, seen in front of the Village's Entrance.

===<span id="Quest 5">Quest #5</span>===
The Fifth and Final Spirit Memory is found once again in the Coliseum, however, instead now having to sit down in front of a statue similar to the one seen in the Village of Dreams. This Memory is with the Young Skater, making you dance with them in front of a live audience. Completing this Quest begins an animation of the Coliseum that explodes with colorful fireworks, and the young skater disappears, fulfilling their ''dream''. Once the animation is over, the player returns to the village to collect the last heart from the Dreams Guide and light snow starts falling on the Village.

==Trivia== 
*The Dancing Performer wore the Admiring Actor's pants from Season of Rhythm in Beta. However, they wear normal pants in the Live version.
*The Peeking Postman's cape is inspired by TGC's previous game, "Journey".
*The Young Skater spirit was formerly unavailable to collect for most players, and thus they weren't able to complete the first and/or second quest. The spirit will either not appear when the player enters the Village, disappear when it is lit, or the Memory Chart will stay full and the spirit's darkness-corrupted body won't appear. It has been noted that the Blushing Prospector and the Pouty Porter have started disappearing too. This was fixed in a new patch, and if the error is persistent, one should leave the area using the home button, and return using the Realm portal. Returning by using the home shrine will not fix the problem. This was fixed by new server deployment in patch 0.12.1.
*Randomly, the player wasn't able to move the camera while in the Village. It lasted about 5 seconds and was caused by another player activating the ski lift that leads to the top of the race track. This was fixed after the Second Memory released, where the cause for the screen freeze was the animation of the boats lifting from the snow and moving. '''This was fixed by new server deployment in patch 0.12.1.'''
* The Season of Dreams is depicted in several merch items from [[That Sky Shop]]. To know more about That Sky Shop products, visit their website: https://thatskyshop.com
