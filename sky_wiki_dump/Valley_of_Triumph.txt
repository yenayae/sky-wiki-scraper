'''Valley of Triumph''', often shortened to ''Valley'', is a radiant snowscape adorned with towering structures, where the echoes of ancient victories resonate. It is the fourth realm the player visits, after the [[Hidden Forest]]. Valley of Triumph is separated into 9 areas<ref>not including the [[Hidden Forest#The Wind Paths|The Wind Paths]]</ref>, loading screens between them all. While the game does not explicitly mention the names of all the areas, it can be derived from landmarks and developer mentions.

Valley holds 7 [[Regular Spirits]] and 16 [[Seasonal Spirits]]. Locations of all available Children of Light, who hold Winged Light, can be found of the [[Children_of_Light#Valley_of_Triumph|Children of Light]] page.

==Social Space==
[[File:Valley SocialSpace1.png|right|300px]]
As with the other levels since [[Daylight Prairie]], the first area of the level is the Social Space where you will find a bonfire, [[Outfit Shrine]], and the [[Regular Spirits]] that you freed in the current Realm. Onwards is a slope leading down to the [[#Ice Rink Slope|Ice Rink]], while to the right of the bonfire is a tunnel entrance to the [[#Village of Dreams|Village of Dreams]] - blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring 1 Regular Spirit from [[Golden Wasteland]] to be relived. Additionally, there is a sapling above the tunnel to the [[#Village of Dream|Village of Dreams]] with a chat bench.

==<span id="Icerink Slope">Ice Rink Slope</span>==
[[File:Valley IceRinkSlope1.png|right|300px]]
From the [[#Social Space|Social Space]], the player can jump onto a slope which sliding down will lead to the Ice Rink. The Ice Rink is a serene area with a frozen lake, allowing players to skate and perform tricks. Overlooking the entire area is a cliff with a Regular Spirit and candles. There is also a winding tunnel leading to a Spirit near the [[#Sliding Race|Sliding Race]] entrance. Additionally, a hidden area beneath the ice that houses jellyfish and a [[Children of Light#Ice Rink|Child of Light]] can be found by breaking the ice of the lake at specific points.

The path splits, allowing the player to either enter the [[#Citadel|Citadel]], blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring 2 Valley Regular Spirits to have been relived, or into the [[#Sliding Race|Sliding Race]]. Both in the end join back together in the [[#Coliseum|Coliseum]].

In the Ice Rink Slope, players can find:

==Sliding Race==
[[File:Valley SlidingRace1.png|right|300px]]
While this is still referred to as a "race", the racing element has long been removed from the game. Despite that, the Sliding Race is timed.

The Sliding Race mainly is comprised of sliding down a slope with various obstacles and broken structures obstructing your path. Fragments of light are scattered around the course, along with light creatures.

In the Sliding Race, players can find:

==Flying Race==
[[File:Valley FlyingRace1.png|right|300px]]
A building beyond the [[#Citadel|Citadel]] area brings players to the Flying Race. The building looks very similar to the [[#Sliding Race|Sliding Race]] building. In this Race, players may collect light fragments just like the Sliding Race.

The Coliseum is split into two sides; blue tents and red tents. The Red Tents hold the [[Season of Dreams]]' events and structures along with access to the [[#Village of Dreams|Village of Dreams]] while the Blue Tents hold the [[Season of AURORA]]'s activities.

[[File:Valley Temple1.png|right|300px]]
Beyond the [[#Coliseum|Coliseum]] lies the Valley Temple, a monument overlooking the entire arena surrounded by two colossal statues. Inside, the Elders' Altar awaits encircled by candles. 

After lighting the altars's candles and meeting them in a cutscene, the doors ahead open and beckons the players to the next realm, [[Golden Wasteland]].

===<span id="Temple Maze">Temple Maze</span>===
[[File:Valley-Temple-Maze.png|thumb|300px|The Temple Maze in the Valley of Triumph]]
<section begin="Temple Maze" />The [[Valley of Triumph#Temple Maze|Temple Maze]] is a Seasonal area added to the [[Valley of Triumph]], introduced with the [[Season of Belonging]] in Patch {{v|0.7.0}}. You can reach this area by going to the Valley Temple, and heading to a hole in the wall to the left of the altar. The hole in the wall was blocked by a Spirit Gate, where during the season it required '''two (2)''' Belonging [[Seasonal Spirits]], but now requires '''one (1)''' [[Regular Spirits|Regular Spirit]] from Wasteland - however the above entrance has no Spirit Gate. This maze is a multi-level, with an entrance gate on the left near the ground, and an exit up above, along the left-side wall as you enter. The [[Sparkler Parent]] is found here, where you follow their memories down the dark maze.<section end="Temple Maze" />

In the Temple Maze, players can find:

Shared Space Shrines are accessible to all players who have access to Daylight Prairie but must have at least two props to access edit mode. You can have up to 16 props available at a time on your Shared Space, but can be much less depending on the "load" of the props as determined by how much the top bar fills up. Within the Valley Shared Spaces, there is a featured prop given to the player to place regardless of if it is owned, being {{Icon|Shared-Spaces-Sparkler-prop-icon-0-aliferous-twiq-0.png|inline_text|link=Shared Spaces|label=Shared Spaces Sparkler}}.

|tab3 = Shard Eruptions
|c3   = <div>A mechanic implemented with the [[Season of Shattering]], shards periodically erupt from the mountain on the horizon, falling multiple times a day in one predetermined location, determined with the daily quest realm (the top of the realm's portal will also have shards embedded). See more in the [[Shard Eruptions]] page. Eruptions in Valley can occur in the following areas:
* Regular Eruptions
** Ice Rink, on the left side besides the hole into the underground part
** Ice Rink, right side, nearby the path to Sliding Race transition
** Ice Rink, on the icerink besides the ledge with the Confident Sightseer atop

|tab4 = Yeti Race
|c4   = <span> In the [[#Hermit Valley|Hermit Valley]], players are able to compete in a race found atop the Hermit's cave. Unlike the Sliding Race or Flying Race found in Valley, the amount of Wax earned at increases based on the amount of light fragments collected throughout the race. In order to begin the race, a minimum of two players are required to sit on top of the start posts on top the cave.
In the first part of the race (from the Hermit Valley to the transition into the Village of Dreams) there is no time limit. However from the Village of Dreams and downwards a timer of 120 seconds begins. A minimum of 150 wax (only one fragment collected) and a maximum of 300 wax (every fragment collected) can be earned depending on the amount of fragments collected. The amount collected is shared between all participants so it is recommended to work together to collect every fragment to earn the maximum amount of wax. This race can only be done once per day.</span>}}

It's wearable and stays on the avatar until they leave the area; they're able to fly, walk around and do everything normally. '''However''' this is only visible on the wearer's client. Nobody else can see you wearing the penguin suit. While reaching it can be done by only flying, it's recommended to have a table and a friend to act as a back-up incase you get lost.

At the very beginning of the [[Season of AURORA#Quest #3|third Quest]] from the Season of AURORA, the text "U=Warrior!" with two firework symbols and a heart appears shortly at the very beginning of the song. This is based on AURORA's song "Warrior", which plays during the Quest, calling the player a warrior, with the "U" standing for "You". The location of the text can be found in the [[#Citadel|Citadel]] in Valley of Triumph, on a ledge behind the corridor with a few candles in it, north-west of the Quest starting point.</div>
