== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|Ia829Fl65yk||inline|Video Guide}}

The Spinning Mentor can be found in the [[Village of Dreams]], nestled in a corner formed by two buildings near the [[Dreams Guide]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Spinning Mentor, who can be seen seen sitting on the perimeter of the ice rink, is approached by the young Skater. The Mentor proceeds to guide the Skater through various techniques they will need to use on the ice. The Mentor advises the Skater to keep their knees bent, and helps work them through the steps needed to perform a spin. When the Skater falls, the Mentor helps them up, and the two are also seen skating together.

At the end of the memory, the young Skater seems to have fallen and is sprawled across the ice. The Spinning Mentor beckons for the young student to rise, and the Mentor proceeds to give a demonstration of the spin that the Skater is trying to master. The Skater, amazed, claps for the Mentor, who politely bows and gestures for the Skater to give it a try. The Skater successfully skates into a spin, and the Mentor nods approvingly.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar throw their hands up to their left before crouching down into a sit spin with one leg out. The sit spin then transitions to a variation of an upright spin, with your avatar reaching up with one hand, raising their body, and craning their head back towards a raised foot. Your avatar will remain spinning until you move; when you do, your avatar will spin out and quickly come to a stop with both hands extended to maintain balance. When your avatar initially throws their hands up, a bright and quick staccato note plays in the background. As you spin, a gentle twinkling noise can be heard. 
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a green light trail following one of your avatar's hands and a blue light trail following the other.
*Level 3 will make your avatar leap into an upright spin with both feet touching the ground and an arm extended above your head. Your avatar will remain spinning until you move; when you do, your avatar will slowly spin to a stop, with their left foot extended slightly and both arms held out to the side. A quick staccato note plays at the beginning of the Expression, similar to note heard at the beginning of Level 1. During the spin, the same gentle twinkling noise plays in the background.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with green light trails following your avatar's hands and feet, plus a blue light trail that spins up and down the length of their body as they turn.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
