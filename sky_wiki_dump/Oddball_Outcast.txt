==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|Ev1SkZRrwV0||inline|Video Guide}}

The Oddball Outcast can be found in the [[Isle of Dawn]], on the far right side of the [[Passage Stone]], past the small cavern where [[Children_of_Light#Isle_of_Dawn_(9)|Isle WL 4]] is located, near the cloud wall. (''Note: Meditate next to the Passage Stone campfire and turn Isle of Dawn to nightfall in order to see this Spirit.'') This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Oddball Outcast can be seen playing alone with a small ball, tossing it between their feet like a hacky sack. The Spirit accidentally drops the ball down the nearby hill and runs to chase after it. A little bit further away, three adolescent Spirits are playing with a much larger ball and one wanders over to invite the Oddball Outcast to come join their group. The Spirit declines and so, shrugging, the group of adolescents resume their game. As the group disappears in the distance, the Oddball Outcast finds themself alone once again.

At the end of the memory, the Oddball Outcast finally recovers their wayward ball and resumes their game of hacky sack, content to play alone while the group of adolescents leave.

*Level 1 will make your avatar spawn a small glowing ball from their right hand before throwing it in the air and tossing it from one foot to the other a few times until it lands back in their right hand and they put it away into their side, while tinking sound effects for each ball toss movement play, as well as a bell sound effect as the light first appears. 
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a thin, glowing, purple trail of light following the movement of the ball.
*Level 3 will make your avatar spawn a small glowing ball from their right hand, while a bell sound effect plays. Then, they will throw it in the air once and reach behind to throw the ball over their back to the front, where they start to toss it between their feet as performed in Level 1, kicking it in varying moves, while tinking sound effects for each kick play. After a few tosses, they accidentally drop the ball, look around, pick up the ball and  put it away into their side.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a thin, glowing, purple trail of light following the movement of the ball.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
