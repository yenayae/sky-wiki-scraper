<section begin="Summary" />The '''Admiring Actor''' is a [[Seasonal Spirit]] from the [[Season of Rhythm]] who offers the {{Emote|Admiring Actor|inline_text}} Expression.

== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|udNx0801Js4||inline|Video Guide}}

The Admiring Actor can be found in the [[Boneyard]] in Hidden Forest, under the first bridge gazebo with an occasional Dark Plant under it. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 3 memory fragments and a 6-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Admiring Actor can be seen wading through the flooded ground of the Boneyard, seeming to scan the surroundings as they look for something. 

Throughout the memory, players will have to make their way through polluted water and rain, endangering the health of the light and the memory fragments. Players can either hurry from fragment to fragment and let the light recharge under shelter before continuing, or completely activate the bridge (including the Jellyfish) before starting the Spirit's memory, as this will stop the polluted rain.

At the end of the memory, the Admiring Actor brings their hands to their mouth and outstretches them, blowing a kiss towards the player.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar squat slightly before standing up tall to blow a kiss with both hands, while a whimsical popping sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a light-pink large heart appearing between the avatar's hands as they blow a kiss.
*Level 3 will make your avatar blow one kiss to their left with just their left hand, and another to their right with just their right hand while whimsical popping sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with two large hearts appearing first to the left and then to the right, in the same order that your avatar blows kisses.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
