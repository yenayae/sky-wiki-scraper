== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|686khkYa93w||inline|Video Guide}}

The Prophet of Air can be found in the [[Cave of Prophecies]], near the entrance to the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Air|Trial of Air]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 5-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Prophet of Air can be seen educating a younger pair of Spirits about the history of the Cave. The Prophet of Air first scolds the young Spirits for arriving late before directing them to a seating area at the center of the Cave of Prophecies. Together, they sit with a larger group of Spirits listening intently to the lessons being provided by all four of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#All_Prophecy_Friendship_Trees|Prophets]]. The group then splits up as the Prophet of Air takes their students aside, leading them towards the entrance of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Air|Trial of Air]]. The lesson continues as all three Spirits test their equilibrium on top of the floating rock platforms.

At the end of the memory, the Prophet of Air teaches the younger Spirits about balance by demonstrating how to perform a handstand.<br>

*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with sparkles following your avatar's feet and a blue trail light following their hands on the dismount.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean backwards into a handstand and repeatedly complete a full turn while a metallic tapping sound effect plays.

*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with trails of golden sparkles following your avatar's feet.

==Trivia==  
*Each [[Season_of_Prophecy#All_Prophecy_Friendship_Trees|Prophet]] is inspired by an animal and represented by an element of nature. The Prophet of Air is inspired by a bat, wearing a bat mask and bat wing cape. The "Balance" Expression may also be based on bats hanging upside down when at rest.
*By using the Prophet of Air's Expression, it is possible to avoid losing light in [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Polluted_Water|Polluted Water]], as the player's hitbox in which they get harmed is only on their lower half.
