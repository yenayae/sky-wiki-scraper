== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|5-k7ChF81Q8||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Gloating Narcissist can be found behind the right statue on the [[Starlight Desert]]'s amphitheater, behind the entrance from [[Vault of Knowledge]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 10-minute [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Gloating Narcissist can be seen enthusiastically performing for an empty amphitheater. At first, they strike dramatic poses on a floating boat that from one side of the stage to the other. Afterwards, the Spirit dismounts to pose directly in front of the various mirrors that populate the stands. Lastly, the Gloating Narcissist ends the performance by taking a bow at center stage.

At the end of the memory, the Spirit pumps up the nonexistent crowd by gesturing widely, in hopes of generating a stronger response.

The Little Prince enters the scene clapping, promoting the Gloating Narcissist to announce, "A traveler from afar is here to admire me. I am the handsomest, best-dressed, richest, and most intelligent man on the island."

Confused, the Little Prince looks around the empty amphitheater and replies, "But you're the only man here."

As if they didn't hear anything, the Gloating Narcissist continues to hype up the nonexistent crowd, calling for them to "Please keep applauding!"

The Little Prince obliges and contemplates aloud, "The grown-ups are certainly very odd."<br>

== Trivia ==
* The Gloating Narcissist is inspired by the Conceited Man in ''[[wp:The_Little_Prince|Le Petit Prince]]'', written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
* The Gloating Narcissist's Music Sheet was altered before the Live release. It is more slow paced and melancholic than the Beta Music Sheet, with a different background track and a slightly altered harmony part. The Beta version of the Music Sheet was later added as {{Music Sheet|25}} [[Music Sheet]] #25.
