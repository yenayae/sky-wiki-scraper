*Level 1 will make your avatar crouch slightly, shift one leg before the other and slightly lift their hands at their sides, while a tinkling sound effect plays. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be cancelled by flying up once. When moved, your avatar will raise their arms and leap sideways towards the ground to gain momentum and perform one cartwheel after another. A playful descending tone plays during each cartwheel.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with white dust clouds appearing where the feet hit the ground after each completed cartwheel.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lift their arms straight into the air and put one pointed foot forward, while several tinkling sound effects play. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be cancelled by flying up once. When moved, your avatar will leap forward to stand on their hands, gain momentum and perform one cartwheel after another. The same playful descending tone as in Level 1 plays during each cartwheel.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with colorful trails of light following the motion of the feet and hands, resulting in a colorful trail of big circles. The right foot and hand have a yellow trail which fades to green, the left hand has a white trail which is only turquoise at the base and turns completely pink, and the left foot has a fully red trail.

<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
