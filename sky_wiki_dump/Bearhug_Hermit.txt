== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|98WLZSrH9fY||inline|Video Guide}}

The Bearhug Hermit can be found in the [[Village of Dreams]] behind the building leading to the platform where boats can be activated to take players to the top of the slope in the Village. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 7 fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
Along the way, steps will help the player carry the Spirit to the top but some controlled flying will be required for portion of the path without steps. As their memory unfolds, the Hermit can be seen following the [[Cheerful Spectator]] and [[Leaping Dancer]] from afar while hiding behind the buildings and on the mountain. Afterwards, the Hermit continues on their mountain path until they spot the little Skater hanging from a cliff.

At the 4th memory, players will need to carry the light from inside the tunnel on your right to the top of the overhang with the little Skater. Let it drop below to activate the 5th memory of the Hermit diving to catch the falling little Skater.

At the end of the memory, the little Skater is grateful that the Hermit saved them from falling. To comfort them, the Hermit gives the little Skater a big bearhug.<br>
