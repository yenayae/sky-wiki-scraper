==Overview==
{{Quote|<br>'''''An enchanted pearl in the Golden Wasteland.'''''|Restored Forgotten Ark Opening}}
The Forgotten Ark is an expansive dune-filled area with a collapsed ark buried in the sands, commanding intrigue and awe from those who behold it. The area, before any quests, begins with the ship entirely stripped of color, with a green fog enveloping the area. As the quests are completed, life is brought to the area, with water getting introduced and the scenery becoming more vibrant. The entrance holds a [[Dark Dragons|Dark Dragon]]. While the dragon's path steers clear of where the player will likely ever be, it is still able to catch sight of them if the player approaches its view. In the center of the area is the Ark, with a farming cave far behind it. There are 6 Seasonal Spirits to find and relive, with the [[Enchantment Guide]] being in the Ark.

===Child of Light Locations===
There are a total of [[Children of Light#Forgotten Ark|2 Children of Light]] in the area.
