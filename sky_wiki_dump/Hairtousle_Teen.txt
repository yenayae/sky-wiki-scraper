<br>
The Hairtousle Teen is found in the [[Underground Caverns]] in Hidden Forest, at the entrance from the [[Elevated Clearing]], near the butterfly jars. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 20-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

At the beginning of the memory, players can burn the wax over the jars containing butterflies and perform a [[Deep Call]], which will make the butterflies gather around the player's avatar and lift them up the cliff to a few [[Flora, Minerals and Elements of Sky#Light Bloom|Light Blooms]], which can be used to ascend further.

As their memory unfolds, the Hairtousle Teen can be seen playing guitar for the [[Pleaful Parent]], sitting besides them. Suddenly, the Hairtousle Teen walks away with their head and shoulders dropped, while the Pleaful Parent runs after them. The two Spirits makes their way to a room that is only accessible through a gate which the Pleaful Parent cannot get through, as it is closed. 

The third fragment is located behind a closed gate, which can only be opened by a button from far away. While the gate does close quickly as soon as the player leaves the button, it is possible to pass through alone, by dashing or flying very quickly when the gate has opened all the way. It will be of most help to have a friend open the gate, before the player passes through and collects the fragment, which will keep the gate open for a bit longer so that the friend can also pass through and join the player.

Inside, the Hairtousle Teen stands infront of a ukulele. They take the instrument with them and play it alone on a cliff behind the room, without the Pleaful Parent. Eventually, the Hairtousle Teen takes off alone and retreats to a spot high up on a mountain, opposite of their room.

To collect the last fragment on top of a high mountain, Jellyfish and Light Blooms can be of help to ascend further and charge the player's wings.

At the end of the memory, the Hairtousle Teen plays a melody on their ukulele, while the player grabs a bell from underneath their cape and rings it, causing the Pleaful Parent to appear infront of the Hairtousle Teen. They stand up and reunite with the Pleaful Parent by playfully tousling their hair. At last, the Pleaful Parent leaves through a tunnel.<br>
