==Record Breaking Concert==
TGC called all Sky Kids to gather on '''Friday, August 25 at 06:00 (PDT UTC-7)''' to join the AURORA Concert and make history by breaking the '''GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™️''' for '''Most Users in a Concert Themed Virtual World'''. The engineers pulled out all the stops to expand the Coliseum capacity to over ''ten thousand (10 000)'' players at once!

The actual record was 10061 players in one server while the total amount across all servers was 1.25 million players attending the concert. The concert broke another record for '''Most Avatars Emoting Simultaneously''' during AURORA's line "It's okay, you can cry."

This special World Record Concert was hosted by the ever-awesome Sky content creator Sarah "[https://www.twitch.tv/nastymold NastyMold]" Hayes, with new [[#Mini-Games|mini-games]] like tug-of-war to play with thousands of your fellow Sky Kids.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar hold your arms to the side with your open palms facing the ground and alternate between swinging each leg out to the side in a bouncy dance while the beat of the "Cure for Me" song plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character. Exiting this Expression will make your avatar raise your arms and hands to shoulder level and shake your head side to side.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with sparkles by the feet and hearts appearing from the hands during the ending gesture.<section end="Expression" />

===Musical Voyage Sneakers===
<section begin="sneakers" />

== Mini-Games ==
The pre-Concert activities are mini-games happening between the Concerts.   

* The Duel
* The Voting Towers
* The Light Parade
* The Great Spheres

===The Duel===
::'''''"Which side will prevail"'''''
The Duel is a game that involves two teams on opposite ends of the Stage. Players can gather in the left or right dome, each featuring a different Expression. Players are invited to honk (spamming the corresponding Emote) - the loudest team will move the center marker beyond the goal line and burst the opposite team's dome, thus winning the competition. All players are propelled back into the Coliseum at the end and new players can join to restart the game. 
<gallery widths="300" spacing="small" captionalign="center">

</gallery>

===The Voting Towers===
::'''''"Make your voice heard"'''''
The Voting Towers are four (4) colored columns on the Stage showcasing different preferences on a particular topic. Players are invited to gather on one choice, making the most liked Tower (or Towers) grow with the number of players. There is no winning or losing in this mini-game; the goal is simply to share preferences with your peers. Choices are refreshed every 2 minutes and players are expelled from the Towers between each topics.

Here are some of the topics seen during the pre-concerts activities: 

* Flow, Flower, Journey, Sky
* Humility, Graciousness, Thoroughness, Patience 
* Butterflies, Birds, Jellies, Mantas
* The Treehouse, Harmony Hall, The Treasure Reef, Starlight Desert
* Earth, Fire, Water, Wind
* Swings, Seesaws, Hammocks, Boats
* Creative, Emotional, Social, Logical
* Cake, Cookies, Candy, Chocolate
* Running, Flying, Surfing, Swimming
* Prophecy Trials, Shard Eruptions, Passages, Assembly Quests
* Honesty, Respect, Loyalty, Compassion
* Sweet, Bitter, Sour, Salty
* Art, Nature, Friendship, Charity
* Invisibility, Flight, Telekinesis, Shapeshifting
* Beach, Mountains, Desert, Lake
* Dancing, Singing, Sitting, Sleeping
* Sunrise, Midday, Sunset, Midnight
* Solo, Collaborative, Competitive, Social

===The Light Parade===
::'''''"A moving procession of lights and sounds"'''''
The Light Parade adds a colorful portal to the center of the Stage, transporting players to a path with arches circling around the Coliseum.  Passing through the arches, players are presented with a certain Emote to spam, thus creating a chain of moving players all using the same Emotes. Expressions are refreshed every 2 minutes. This activity is based around the natural highway that players made during the first iterations of the Concert on December 2022.

</gallery>

===The Great Spheres===
::'''''"Largest ballgame in the realms"'''''
Two (2) large Spheres and two (2) large goals are set up at each end of the Coliseum. Using the {{Emote|Levitating Adept|inline_text}} Expression, players can guide the Spheres to their corresponding goals. Each team can score up to 10 total goals. Over time, the Spheres reduce in size and become much more difficult to maneuver as they can get stuck in smaller areas.   The Spheres return to their normal size and to the center of the Coliseum after a team scores a goal.
