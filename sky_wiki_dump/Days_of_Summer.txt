==August 2021==
<section begin="Summary" />To celebrate the summer, Days of Summer began on '''August 12 (00:00 PDT, UTC-7) through August 25 (23:59 PDT) 2021'''. For the occasion Home space was decorated with a little beach adorning a sand castle, the Days of summer guide, a tunnel under the sand castle and a fire pit. A floating island gave players the ability to chat and players were able to get some light by lighting seashells and hanging near the fire pit. Themed items for this event were offered through the Summer Guide, in-game shop and [[Traveling Spirits]].<section end="Summary" />

[[Days of Summer Lights]] was a later phase of the event and the lantern from last year returned for the occasion as an [[Premium Candle Shop|in-app purchase]].

Players were able to collect free spells of the Days of Summer guide items from the Sleepy Traveler’s boat to try out all of the new items. ''Each of these temporary spells last for 30 minutes.''
