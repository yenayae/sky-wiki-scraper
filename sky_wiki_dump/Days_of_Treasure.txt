<section begin="Summary"/>Welcome to '''Days of Treasure''', where maps be mysterious, shovels be plenty, and bounty be ripe for the plunderin’! From '''Monday, March 3, 2025 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' through '''Sunday, March 16, 2025 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', mind your sea legs and gather 'round, for adventure calls in the land of the seven [[realms]]!

A series of enchanted maps have drifted into the realms of Sky, leading to troves of hidden wonders. But beware, for the sands of time slip swiftly through the glass, and once the map’s magic fades, so too will the treasures! Aye, ye must be swift, sharp, and ready to heave ho!<section end="Summary"/>

Each day, two daring teams of [[Spirits]] set sail—er, set forth—on a grand treasure hunt, each eager to uncover the loot before their rivals. The noble Scouts seek fortune with keen eyes and steady hands, while the cunning Scavengers rely on wits and wild instincts. But which crew will chart the course to victory? That, me hearties, be up to ye!

So hoist yer Spirits high, sharpen yer wits, and let the hunt begin! Riches, rivalry, and revelry await, but tarry not—the magic won’t last forever!<br>
