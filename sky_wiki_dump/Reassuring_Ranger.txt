The Reassuring Ranger can be found in the [[Prairie Peaks]] right next to the [[Moments Guide]], hidden behind the raised platform where the area's [[Map_Shrines#Daylight_Prairie|Map Shrine]] is located. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Moments Guide and the Reassuring Ranger can be seen climbing the nearby hills. As they ascend, they reach a steep section and the Moments Guide stays behind, completely frozen by fear. The Reassuring Ranger goes back to reassure their companion and together they finally reach their destination. Side by side, they pause to catch their breath, gazing out at the awe-inspiring beauty that unfolds before their eyes. The Prairie Peaks lay below them, a tapestry of vibrant greens and earthen tones.

At the end of the memory, the Reassuring Ranger holds the Moments Guide by their shoulders, quietly admiring the beauty of the Prairie Peaks, side by side.

*Level 1 will make your avatar turn to your friend and extend their right arm for a side hug. Upon accepting, your avatar will hug your friend while facing the same direction by extending one arm over each other's shoulder, while two high-pitched wind chime notes play.
*Level 2 will make your avatar turn to your friend, tilt their head to the side, and open up both arms to each side for a hug. Upon accepting, your avatar will hug your friend from the side while both look forward, pulling them over to themselves with one arm, the impact of the pull making your friend support themselves on your avatar's shoulder with their other arm that isn't hugging your avatar, while wind chime notes play.
