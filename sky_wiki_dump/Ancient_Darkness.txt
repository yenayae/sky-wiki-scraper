==Traveling Spirit==
During the [[Season of Shattering]], there were two separate Friendship Trees for the Ancient Darkness' [[collectibles]]. In front of the Ancient Darkness structure, the '''Dragon Tree''' could be found, offering items mostly themed around [[Dark Dragons]], hence the informal name. Behind it was the '''Darkness Plant Tree''', offering items themed mostly around [[Flora, Minerals and Elements of Sky#Darkness|Darkness Plants]]. Despite differing from Seasonal Spirits, the Shattering entities are confirmed to return in the future <ref>In the  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/x85xze/comment/innethr/ Season of Shattering TGC Designer Q&A on Reddit], TGC_Atlas answered the question "How will the 'Spirits' for this season work when it comes to Travelling Spirits? Will they ever return?" with "They will return. It will be a while though. We have a few ideas currently and are still considering what is the best way to re-introduce them in the future."</ref>.
