The Cackling Cannoneer can be found in the [[Treasure Reef]], on the big island to the player's left-handed side where the [[Abyss Guide]]'s ship is docked, past the [[Bumbling Boatswain]] and near a broken, wooden boat. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Cackling Cannoneer can be seen carrying a harpoon gun and sauntering up the slope with the [[Abyss Guide]], who carries a rolled-up target sheet. They stop at a broken wall to prepare for what seems like target practice. The Cannoneer gestures the Abyss Guide to hurry ahead to nail the target sheet to a faraway wall before running back to take cover. Once the two Spirits are safely out of the way, the Cackling Cannoneer takes aim and shoots - hitting the bullseye dead-on. The two Spirits go and observe the target sheet, happy with the shot.  

At the end of the memory, the Abyss Guide punches the air in delight while the Cackling Cannoneer throws their head back and arms halfway up while laughing heartily and gleefully, pleased by the incredibly successful shot.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar throw back their head and lift up their clenched fists before laughing heartily, their whole body shaking with the motion, while dark bassoon sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with red flames igniting and quickly flaming up as your avatar lifts their hands, then burning in place from their hands. This level is also accompanied by a flame igniting sound effect at the beginning of the Expression.
*Level 3 will make your avatar start to laugh slowly, with their head tilted down and their hands close to their body, before spreading their legs further apart, throwing their head back, and lifting up their arms with clenched fists away from their body while laughing manically, while rising bassoon sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with several high red flames igniting around your avatar on the ground as soon as they spread their legs further apart.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
