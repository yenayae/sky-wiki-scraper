*Level 1 will make your avatar raise their hands in front of their chest, palms loosely facing down, and rhythmically circle them counter clockwise while rocking their body along to the synth beat playing during the Expression. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon canceling the Expression, your avatar will position their arms parallel to each other, palms facing inwards, before slightly shaking their arms in place.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a glowing blue circle flickering on each wrist as the dance is performed.
*Level 3 will make your avatar shortly start rocking their body before energetically walking in place with rhythmic steps, rocking their body from side to side and pumping their hands back and forth, all in rhythm with a synth beat playing during the Expression. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon canceling the Expression, your avatar will come to a halt, tilt their body sideways and cross their arms.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with white starbursts appearing at the hands, white trails following the feet and tiny white sparkles bursting at the ground as the feet touch it. Upon canceling the Expression, all effects disappear and two vertical lines of golden particles appear in front of the legs, before they slowly rise up and fade.

<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
