==Trivia==
* The appearance of the [[#Seasonal Pendant|Assembly Seasonal Pendant]] is based off of the scouts, an organization for children all around the world that also focuses on outdoor activities and crafts much like the Spirits of this Season.
* The Assembly Guide was the first Guide to permanently offer cosmetics even after the Season ended.
