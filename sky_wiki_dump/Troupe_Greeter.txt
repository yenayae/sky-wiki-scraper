The Troupe Greeter can be found in the middle of [[Isle of Dawn]], to the right of the stone ramp farthest away from the Temple.<ref name="Location change">The Troupe Greeter was originally found directly next to [[Passage Stone]] at the center of Isle, but was moved a few feet away in Patch {{v|0.21.5}} to make room for the newly added bonfire and [[Passage Stone]] meditation circle.</ref> This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Troupe Greeter can be seen traveling across the sand dunes of the Isle, steadily heading towards the Temple. The Spirit eventually reaches the island in the clouds and steps inside the entrance hallway of the building, pleased to have reached their destination.

At the end of the memory, the Troupe Greeter twirls a hand while sweeping their arm backwards,  gesturing towards the Temple doors as if to welcome the player inside.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar twirl their right hand as they sweep their arm backwards with their left arm tucked behind their back, twisting their body to face the same direction of the movement, while harp sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a white trail of light following the gesturing hand.
*Level 3 will make your avatar sweep both arms backwards in succession, twisting their body and taking a step to face the same direction of the movement, while harp sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with green trails of light following both hands, as well as a white trail of light towards the end.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
