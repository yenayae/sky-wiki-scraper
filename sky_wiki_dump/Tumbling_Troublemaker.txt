<div>{{#ev:youtube|LQAdsM3l6vg||inline|Video Guide}}

The Tumbling Troublemaker can be found in the [[Isle of Dawn]], on the far right side of the [[Passage Stone]], past the small cavern where [[Children_of_Light#Isle_of_Dawn_(9)|Isle WL 4]] is located. (''Note: Meditate next to the Passage Stone campfire and turn Isle of Dawn to nightfall in order to see this Spirit.'') This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Tumbling Troublemaker can be seen dancing while two other young Spirits are busy collecting stones in a basket. The playful Spirit then juggles two stones while the other two carry their basket onwards across the dunes. Halfway down a small incline, the Tumbling Troublemaker trips and starts rolling alongside the stones they dropped. At the bottom of the slope, the Tumbling Troublemaker and the stones crash into the other two Spirits, knocking them down and causing their basket to go flying.

At the end of the memory, the Tumbling Troublemaker raises their head, a little dazed, as the other two Spirits burst into laughter and shake their heads in dismay.

*Level 1 will make your avatar squat down with both arms stretched out in front of them, while a squeaky toy sound effect plays. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be canceled by jumping or flying up once. When moved, your avatar will start rolling forward along the ground, bringing their feet over their head. A squeaky toy sound effect plays at each completed revolution.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a trail of small, glowing, orange particles of light flying vertically around your avatar with each roll.
*Level 3 will make your avatar squat down with their arms held close to their body and their hands placed on their knees, while a squeaky toy sound effect plays. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be canceled by jumping or flying up once. When moved, your avatar will start rolling forward just as in Level 1, but at a much faster pace with their body held closely together, making them look like a blurred ball. A squeaky toy sound effect will play at each completed revolution.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a wide trail of small, glowing, golden particles of light following your avatar's trail on the ground.

<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
