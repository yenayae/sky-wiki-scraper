The Cellist's Beginnings is found in the [[Concert Hall]] in [[Aviary Village]], within the curtained hallway behind the stage after completing the [[Season of Duets#Quest #1|first Seasonal Quest]]. Unlike typical [[Seasonal Spirits]], there is no need to first relive a [[Spirit Memories|spirit memory]] to access this Shop and it does not offer an [[Expression]]. The collectibles offered by this Shop are an {{Spirit Item|The Cellist's Beginnings|Outfit|inline_text}}, a {{Spirit Item|The Cellist's Beginnings|Hair|inline_text}}, and a {{Spirit Item|The Cellist's Beginnings|Prop|inline_text|label=Conch Wall Poster Prop}}.<section end="Summary" />

===<span id="Prop">Prop</span>===
The [[Prop]] offered by this Shop is a blue and white rectangular poster that depicts a bubbling conch sitting on a round base (closely resembling the [[Nesting Workshop#Music Player|Music Player Prop]]). It is a placeable Prop that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]]. This item is purely cosmetic and does not offer any functionality. When carried on its owner's back, it appears as a blue bag with a yellow drawstring. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node ({{Cost|46 SC|season=Duets}} total).<br>
