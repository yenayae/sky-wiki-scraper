The Season of Performance takes place in a new area in '''Valley of Triumph'''. Visit the stage tucked away in a sleepy mountain village. Meet the Performance Guide and a group of four performer Spirits to share their imagination and passion with an audience! Complete seasonal quests to inspire this team to create something bigger than any one person could achieve alone, and learn how to use the new stage for performances you might imagine, too.<br>

==Welcome==
<center class="title-text-welcome">[https://www.thatskygame.com/news/the-curtains-rise-for-season-of-performance Welcome to the Season of Performance!]</center>
{{Quote|<br/>'''''It's showtime!'''''}}
The Season of Performance follows the adventures of four Season Spirits who share their imagination and passion for the stage. Join a young group of Spirits determined to share their inspiration with the world, and take on a role of your own as they learn together how to create something greater than one person could achieve on their own. Relive each Spirits' memories to learn their expressions, and gain the opportunity to unlock a series of masks, outfits, music sheets, and hairstyles—not to mention, an instrument that offers a frequently requested feature: sustained notes!

''<small>*Note that Season of Performance can be enjoyed by all players who have collected at least one Golden Wasteland spirit.</small>''

==The Village Theater==
{{Quote|<br>'''''A place to play many parts'''''|Village Theater Opening}}
The Season of Performance takes place in an addition to the Valley of Triumph called "Village Theater", accessible from the Village of Dreams. Take a right after entering Village of Dream and enter a small area surrounded by hills and clouds, featuring a theater where players can have fun recreating a play or simply giving an instrumental performance on stage. Throughout the quests, players will activate many additional features to improve the theater, the experience of the performers, and the audience.

On the stage, all privacy barriers are removed, meaning you now see all players without lighting them and your conversations are now public. Players sitting on the audience benches can see you and your conversations as well. It's a great way to introduce yourself to potential new friends but also to facilitate the act you're taking part in.<br>
<br>

==[[Harmony Hall]]==
[[Harmony Hall]] is a second map area that was added to the game in the middle of the Season of Performance. The front entrance (from [[Village of Dreams]]) is available to all players who can access the village. However, there is a second back entrance leading directly from the [[Village Theater]] that is only available to players after completing the [[#Quest 4|fourth quest]].

===<span id="Quest 2">Quest #2</span>===
::'''Act II: Write a Story for Isle of Dawn'''
In this quest, you are tasked to help the '''Forgetful Storyteller''' to write a story about Isle of Dawn. They have forgotten their lines.

On the stage, choices will be prompted for you. Direct the plot by choosing a unique storyline to tell and as you select one or another, the story will unveil itself in front of the theater crew. Once done, speak to the Performance Guide. More Spirits are now gathered for the occasion with the Performance Guide on the audience.

After you have completed the second act, you now have access to the '''Narrator's chair''' and the '''Daily prompter'''. The Narrator's chair will position your Sky kid behind the scene and let you whisper the "line" to your actors or give directions to those on the stage. The Daily prompter will give you advice or ideas for your play.<br>

===<span id="Quest 3">Quest #3</span>===
::'''Act III: Rehearse a Song about Vault of Knowledge'''
In this quest, you are tasked to help the band rehearse a song about Vault of Knowledge. The Mellow Musician is missing and you need to fill in for them in the band.

The curtain opens and two musicians are on the scene. Pick up the instrument and play the song with the band to proceed. Once the rehearsal is finished, speak with the Performance Guide. On the side, the Mellow Musician is having a nap and the musicians are displeased. But as they laugh about it, they all go back on stage and the Mellow Musician gives their performance. Two instruments located on the front of the stage are now available to use whenever you wish (a {{Instrument|Guitar|inline_text}} and a {{Instrument|Prophecy Drum|inline_text}}).<br>
<br>

===<span id="Quest 4">Quest #4</span>===
::'''Act IV: Encourage the Discouraged Crew'''
In this quest, you are tasked to reassure the spirits, as they are discouraged about their production. They seem to have lost faith in themselves.

The Performance guide is looking for someone to cheer them up and one by one we see them, shoulders down. Find and visit each of them to cheer them up. As you perform your tasks they will take your hand and help you find the next one. Once you're done, return to the Performance Guide with your re-energized crew. Now that the spirits are hopeful again, you all gather next to the Daily prompter and the Performance Guide gives an inspirational speech.

You now have access to the back entrance to [[Harmony Hall]].<br>
<br>

===<span id="Quest 5">Quest #5</span>===
::'''Act V: Finale Act'''
In this quest, you are tasked to help the Modest Dancer to close out the big show and the Frantic Stagehand prepare the stage.

One by one we can see all the crew performing on the stage and the audience is delighted. Backstage, the Modest Dancer is stretching, ready to get on stage for their act. Visit the planning table (located on the top level backstage) before the final act begins. Help the Frantic Stagehand prepare the stage by activating the levers as instructed. Once done, the Forgetful Storyteller introduces the Modest Dancer for their act, but they are nowhere to be found. They seem to have a bit of stage fright and cannot perform; offer them support. Improvise with the Mellow Musician on the stage while the Modest Dancer regains confidence by playing a composition of your own for a few minutes. As the Modest Dancer finally comes back, use your expressions to put on a dancing routine with the Modest Dancer.

The crowd is happy and bouquets of flowers are thrown toward the stage. Speak with the Performer Guide now that the performance has finished.

Everyone is called onto the stage for the last ovation and the Performer guide sees in the crowd a long-lost relative. As they head out to greet them, you bow to the crew and they vanish in 4 columns of light to conclude the adventure. The Performer Guide is ecstatic to see their twin sibling: The Ultimate Guide from the [[Season of Rhythm]].

The ten bouquets of flowers thrown by the crowd can be collected to receive 3-10 [[#Pieces of Light Locations|pieces of light]] per bouquet. The bouquets reappear every day.<br>

==[[Shared Memories Candles]]==
{{#lst:Shared Memories Candles|Summary}}Sometime during season of performance, a guide to shared memories was added, in which frantic stagehand told players what to do with them, and how they work.<!-- Images needed -->

==The Penguin==
On a hill behind the Theater, you will find a lone Penguin waiting for you to wear like a mascot costume. Since there are wind walls all around the Village Theater it is a bit of a challenge to reach. Players have found a very specific flight path you can take to get there but if you run out of wings and hit the clouds you'll respawn near the Performance guide. Patience is the key to success. Once you wear the outfit you will keep it for as long as you want and return to the Village Theater to play, but as soon as you exit the area, the suit will be removed. Only the holder can see the costume, even though the friends you brought with you also wear it.
