March 20th, 2025: Beta access is now closed to all testers.   TGC started a next phase of the beta program—one that meets the unique needs of Sky, supports more stages of development, and opens new avenues for hearing player's insights and feedback. 

NDAs will be required of all testers. NDAs are legal agreements that protect certain types of information from being shared publicly. For the beta program, this means that no beta footage or content can be recorded or shared by testers outside of private beta channels on Discord designated by TGC, unless specified by TGC.  

For that reason, we will no longer publish drafts in the Sky wiki outside the given "free to publish" period. You can contact an active admin or mod via our individual Walls or through the {{Sky Wiki Socials|Discord|format=inline}}.

<br>

==Welcome==
<center class="title-text-welcome">[https://www.thatskygame.com/news/LINK-TO-NEWS-RELEASE Welcome to the Season of Migration!]</center>{{Quote|<br>'''''Embark on a mystical journey of light and wonder as you help a herd of lost light creatures find their way home.'''''}}
From the open fields to the shadowed forests and beyond, a stirring has begun. An ancient rhythm that calls the migrating creatures of light to rise, gather, and journey together. Guided by the [[Migration Guide]], you will help shepherd a lost herd of majestic creatures back onto their ancestral path. 

Over the course of 10 [[Spirit Memory Quests|Seasonal Quests]], you will join in leading the herd across familiar Realms transformed: Daylight Prairie buffeted by strong winds, Hidden Forest overflowing with floodwaters, Golden Wasteland wrapped in heavy fog. Along the way, you will soar beside Jellyfish, Mantas, Birds, and other beloved creatures, seeing them in surprising new ways as the migration carries on through the skies.

In the [[Wind Paths]], new Spirit memories are waiting to be discovered. Keep an eye out for hints near the migration camp in Isle of Dawn: they'll guide you to where those memories can be found. The Season's Spirits will teach you new Expressions and offer a variety of cosmetics: [[Outfits]], [[Capes]], a new [[Music Sheet]], and more! [[Season Pass]] holders will also have the chance to unlock three new Ultimate Gifts.

This Season is one of triumph and wonder, of finding the way home, and of discovering how deeply connected we are—not just to each other, but to the luminous creatures who share our world.

<small>Note that Season of Migration can be enjoyed by all players who have progressed through at least REALM.</small>

==Daily Quests & Seasonal Candles==
===Daily Quests===
Collect Seasonal Candles throughout the Season to trade with the new Spirits for their cosmetics. A total of 6 Seasonal Candles are available to gather, as follows:
*Each day the location of the [[Daily Quests]] change, indicated through the cutscene played when checking in with the Return Shrine Statue at [[Home]] or [[Aviary Village]] - where the camera will pan out from the day's chosen Realm portal. Players will earn one Seasonal Candle per Quest completed. Complete your Quests and claim your reward at the Return Shrine Statue. (4 Candles)
*Players may also collect an extra Candle by collecting the 4 Seasonal bunches <small>(more information on the "Seasonal bunches locations" below).</small> (1 Candle)
*Players who have the [[Season Pass]] can claim a Seasonal Candle from the Return Shrine Statue at [[Home]] or the [[Aviary Village#Friendship Constellation Statue|Friendship Constellation Statue]] at Aviary Village as a free daily bonus. (1 Candle)

==Spirit Memory Quests==

===<span id="Quest 1">Quest #1</span>===
In the first Quest, [Quest summary]. The Migration Guide discovers an abandoned pair of antlers atop a hill in the Isle of Dawn desert and decides to wear them. Looking ahead, they notice a flock of sleeping antlered manatees. As they approach and wave to the creatures, the temple bell rings, awakening the flock, which begins to circle joyfully around the Guide.

The Guide then turns to the Migrating Bellmaker, who reveals that their boat is broken.

'''Part I – Repairing the Boat'''

Sit on the meditation circle to be transported near the buried boat, where the Migrating Bellmaker awaits your help. Three beams of light mark the areas where the missing parts can be found.

Collect six boat pieces from these marked zones. If you lose your way, honk to summon a blue guiding star that points toward your next objective. Meanwhile, the Migration Guide tends to the Light Creature flock in the background.

Once all parts are gathered, return to the Migrating Bellmaker and tap the hammer icons to repair the boat. When the task is complete, the Whisperer readies it for the upcoming voyage.

'''Part II – The Migration Bells'''

Next, the Migration Guide entrusts you with a bell worn on your back to help prepare the Migration Bells. Follow the beams of light to each location and light the nearby candles to activate the bells.

There are four bells in total. When all are lit, they chime together in harmony, summoning butterfly swarms that form glowing paths leading toward the temple. Return to the Migration Guide to continue.

'''Part III – Leading the Voyage'''

With the Light Creature flock gathered, the Migration Guide heads back to the repaired boat, ready to set off.

Select the flying icon to lead the voyage. The Migrating Bellmaker and the Migration Guide join you aboard as you follow one of the butterfly paths toward the temple.

As the journey concludes, the Migrating Bellmaker thanks you and begins preparations for the next expedition. The Migration Guide and the flock finally rest, marking the end of this stage of the journey.

An antler remains on the right hill of the Prairie, hinting at the next quest to come.<!--<br>
<br>
{{#ev:youtube|VideoID|300px||Quest 1 Video Guide}}-->

<!--
===<span id="Quest 2">Quest #2</span>===
In the second Quest, [Quest summary]. In the Prairie, the Migration Guide, the Migrating Bellmaker, and the Light Creature flock prepare to continue their journey. However, strong winds have startled the migrating birds, halting their progress.

'''Part I – Restoring the Migration Bells'''
To calm the winds and guide the birds, the Spirits enlist your help in repairing the Migration Bells.

You are given a migration bell to assist with the task.

There are four bells scattered across the area that must be restored. Follow the guiding lights to each location and repair the bells one by one.

When all four are fixed, they ring together in harmony, creating waves of light that steady the winds and free the birds to resume their migration.

Return to the Migration Guide once the bells have been activated.

'''Part II – Leading the Flock'''

With the bells restored and the boat ready, the Spirits prepare to set sail once more.

Take the lead by selecting the flying icon, guiding the group along the birds’ migration paths.

Fly above the temple, following the glowing trails of the Light Creatures. You may use flight power to accelerate at any time during the journey.

'''Part III – Journey’s End'''

Upon reaching the Prairie Village, the Migrating Bellmaker thanks you before returning to prepare for the next voyage.

The Migration Guide and the Light Creature flock finally rest after completing their journey.

An antler remains behind on the middle belltower island, marking the path forward for the next quest.<br>

-->The Migrating Bird Whisperer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], at the top of a floating island, left of the main island. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments.

As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Bird Whisperer can be seen sitting in the gras alongside the [[Light Whisperer]], watching [[Birds]] fly by. Suddenly, the Spirits jump to their feet as they spot an injured Bird, separated from the flock, just above their island. The Migrating Bird Whisperer quickly runs towards the Bird and gently catches it. They bring it to the base of the small island, inside the Light Whisperer's workshop, where they carefully placd the Bird on a pillow. After some rest, the Spirits bring the Bird outside and let it fly free, where it is welcomed by their flock. Uplifted by their good deed, the Bird Whisperer frolicks across the field, before they stop and watch the swarm fly away, touched by this wonderful moment.

At the end of the memory, the Migrating Bird Whisperer happily runs across the grass before watching the huge swarm of Birds fly across the sky, completely in awe. Touched by this wonderful moment, they place their hands above their heart.

*Level 1 will make your avatar hold out their arms straight to each side and relax their eyes. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be canceled by jumping or flying up once. When moved, your avatar will run around while slightly swaying their arms up and down.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with trails of small golden sparkles following the avatar's hands.
*Level 3 makes the same motion as Level 1, except that the motion is slower and the avatar flaps their arms up and down, as if imitating a butterfly.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with sparkles appearing at the hands during the initial motion and yellow glowing lights trailing them with each flap.

<!--<div>{{#ev:youtube|YoutubeID|200px|inline|Video Guide}}-->

The Migrating Butterfly Charmer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on the main island, right of the [[Flight Guide]], on a ledge near a flying-boat dock. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments. 

As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer can be seen in the middle of a solo picnic, as a [[Butterfly]] flies onto their arm, startling the Spirit. The Butterfly flies off and the Spirit stumbles after them. After a bit of a chase, the Spirit comes across a big swarm of more Butterflies, joined by the one they just followed. Fascinated, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer follows the swarm down the hill, completely in focus. The Spirit attempts to reach the Butterflies by jumping up, but instead they stumble further down the hill, which they eventually tumble down. At the foot of the hill, the Spirit sits on the ground, dizzy from their turbulous journey, but happily surrounded by Butterflies.

At the end of the memory, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer sits on the ground while their head turns from dizzyness. They shake it out and stand back up, to surprisingly see an even bigger swarm of Butterflies flying up into the sky near them. Happy about such a special moment, they raise up their arms and take in the scenery.

*Level 3 will make your avatar strumble forward and backward, their head and arms swaying out of balance, before they fall to the ground and stay there as their head turns around in circles, while swaying whistle sound effects play. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon doing so, the avatar will shake their head out and stand up, still a bit out of balance.

The Migrating Jelly Whisperer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on the main island, to the left of the [[Flight Guide]], behind an opening in the ground. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments.

As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Jelly Whisperer can be seen sneaking up on some [[Jellyfish]]. Once they're close, they climb up a ledge and jump into the middle of the unsuspecting Jellyfish flock, which immeditately scurry away, though not very far. The Whisperer watches as the Jellyfish leave, before the trying their luck again as they carefully follow the creatures to their new spot. This time, the Jellyfish spot the Spirit earlier, but as they begin to fly away, the Whisperer reaches out after them. The flock stops and turns around, coming back to the Migrating Jelly Whisperer. At last, their wish is granted as the flock lifts them up in the air, where the Spirit floats and dances amongst their newly found friends.

At the end of the memory, the Migrating Jelly Whisperer stands by the Jellyfish, jumping and performing pirouettes in the air. They stop their joyous dance to watch another group of small and big Jellyfish pass by and fly high up into the sky.
