{{Quote|<br>You burrowed down, surrounded yourself in stone. <br> You closed your eyes to blindly drive out Light that stood in the way.<br>But still the colors of compassion sought you when you trembled in darkness,<br> and finally you learned to see the Light that reaches to us all.}}

*Level 1 will make your avatar start to rhythmically and gently move their body up and down, before raising their arms and pushing them up and down, looking around a bit every now and then, while rhythmic hi-hat and ride drum sounds sounds play. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, but with white light orbs moving up and down beside each of the avatar's sides, in rhythm with their motion.
*Level 3 will make your avatar stand with their legs spread in a 90 degree angle, raising their arms above their head before rhythmically pushing their body and arms up and down, stretching out each leg once in a while, while rhythmic drum sounds play. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, but with big white sparkles dancing up and down above your avatar, in rhythm with their motion.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
