<!--<section begin="Quote" />{{Quote|<br>'''QUOTE.'''|Moominvalley Opening}}<section end="Quote" /> -->
<section begin="Summary" />'''Moominvalley''' is a Seasonal area added to [[Vault of Knowledge]], introduced with the [[Season of Moomin]] in Update [[Update:Live_0.27.0_(294170_Android,_Huawei)_(292054_iOS,_PlayStation,_Steam,_Switch)|0.27.0]]. All the Quests, Spirits, and activities can be found in the area. To enter Moominvalley, head to the [[Vault of Knowledge#Collaboration Room|Collaboration Room]] in the Vault of Knowledge - left from where the player spawns once heading into the Vault portal. The doorway is blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring '''one (1)''' [[Regular Spirit]] from Vault to enter. Once inside, sit at the meditation circle in front of the {{Season Icon|Moomin|inline_text|label=Moomin}} mural. Explore the enchanting world of Tove Jansson’s classic characters and discover the ways that friendship and acceptance can restore color, no matter how faded the world may seem.<section end="Summary" />

==Overview==
Moominvalley is a whimsical, idyllic setting from the beloved [[wp:Moomins|''Moomins'']] series created by Finnish-Swedish author Tove Jansson. It features rolling hills, lush forests, and serene lakes, creating a picturesque landscape filled with charm and tranquility. The valley is home to the Moomins, a family of round, gentle creatures resembling hippos, along with a variety of other quirky characters, each with their own stories and adventures.

The entirety of Moominvalley is depicted in grayscale, with spots of color only appearing during [[#Activities|certain activities]], and on any objects or surfaces near the player. In addition, players are only able to explore Moominvalley while transformed into a [[Butterflies|Butterfly]], limiting the number of actions they are able to perform.

===Moominvalley Glade===
[[File:Moominvalley-Glade-Main.png|thumb|x150px|Moominvalley Glade]]
Moominvalley Glade is a small but vibrant forest clearing, isolated within a vast expanse of mirrored floor and surrounded by darkness. A series of parallel platforms - one stone, the other grassy - lead towards a lonely gazebo containing a [[Child of Light]] in the distance. [[The Moomin Storybook|The Moomin Storybook]] can be found here, alongside the [[#Spirits in Moominvalley|Moomin Seasonal Shops]] and a portal to [[Aviary Village]].

Players will first arrive here when traveling from the [[Vault of Knowledge#Collaboration Room|Collaboration Room]] in the Vault of Knowledge. To enter Moominvalley proper, sit at the meditation circle next to a campsite on the left side of the central forest.

Visually, Moominvalley Glade is very similar to the [[The_Void_of_Shattering_(Location)|Void of Shattering (Location)]] and the six [[Season_of_Shattering#Spirit_Memory_Quests|Ancient Memory]] voids. Unlike those areas, however, Moominvalley Glade has a unique color draining effect not seen anywhere else: the color of players and the environment itself shifts into grayscale when moving away from the central forest area.
