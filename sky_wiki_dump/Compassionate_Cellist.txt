<section begin="Summary" />The '''Compassionate Cellist''' is a [[Seasonal Spirit]] from the [[Season of Duets]]. The Compassionate Cellist is found in the [[Concert Hall]] in [[Aviary Village]], in the curtained-off area behind the backstage hallway where the [[Season of Duets#Spirits & Cosmetics|Duets Seasonal Shops]] can be found. This Seasonal Spirit is particularly unique compared to others, requiring players to first complete the [[Season of Duets#Quest #4|fourth Seasonal Quest]] to access their cosmetics and they do not offer an [[Expression]]. In addition, this Spirit remains '''permanently available''' after the Season ends. The collectibles [[Compassionate Cellist#Friendship Tree|offered]] by this Spirit are a {{Spirit Item|Compassionate Cellist|Facepiece|inline_text}} and the {{Spirit Item|Compassionate Cellist|Instrument|inline_text|label=Duets Cello Instrument}}.<section end="Summary" /><br>
