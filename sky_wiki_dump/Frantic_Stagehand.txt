The Frantic Stagehand can be found in the [[Village Theater]], on the player's left when entering from [[Village of Dreams]], between two buildings that face the Theater's stage. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Frantic Stagehand can be seen carrying a large pile of props over to the Village Theater's stage. The [[Mellow Musician]] is seen leaning against a nearby building, and watches as the Stagehand drops a small item. The Stagehand walks back to pick up the fallen item, and continues on their way. After this, they drop a much bigger prop, and Musician rushes over to help pick up the larger prop. The two Spirits both carry the props together, sharing the workload for the rest of the walk.

At the end of the memory, the two Spirits pause for a moment after dropping off the props near the backstage entrance. The Musician wipes their forehead, and Stagehand dusts off their hands. The Frantic Stagehand then extends a hand to the Mellow Musician, and the two gently shake hands.

*Level 1 will make your avatar extend their right hand before your friend, allowing them to shake your hand. You will gently shake your hands up and down while a series of bongo and percussion sound effects play.
*Level 2 will make your avatar extend their right hand just as in Level 1, but when your friend accepts and holds out their hand, you will complete the handshake with two hands instead of one. Your hands will clasp around your friend's hand, and you will shake your friend's hand much more quickly than in Level 1. During this second Level, similar bongo and percussion sound effects play at a more rapid tempo. 

Like any [[Friendship Menu#Extended Two-Player Abilities|Extended Two-Player Ability]], this ability can be upgraded by opening your friend's Friendship Menu. To reach the 12th node before the ability, it will cost you {{Cost|41 C}} and {{Cost|16 AC}}. (See [[Friendship Menu]] to view the entire Friendship Tree). Unlocking the Level 1 ability will cost you {{Cost|16 C}}. After unlocking Level 1, it will cost you {{Cost|18 C}} more to upgrade to Level 2.

As a Returning Spirit, the price of the Friend Action upgrade was {{Cost|8 H}}. During the Season, Level 1 was free, but Level 2 was only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
