The Dismayed Hunter can be found in [[Boneyard]], under a ledge to the right after entering the area from [[Forest's Brook]]. (Early [[Sky Beta|Beta]] testers know this area as [[Tree Tunnels|"Tree Tunnels".]]) This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. All of the memory fragments are [[Spirit Health|sheltered]] from the [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Rain|rain]].

As their memory unfolds, the Dismayed Hunter is seen stalking through the hollow tree tunnels with a bow in hand, seemingly in an attempt to hunt. The Spirit then pauses to take aim at an unseen entity but ends up losing sight of their prey.

At the end of the memory, the Dismayed Hunter stands at the end of the tree tunnels and clutches their head as they glance around, distraught by their failed hunting attempt.<br>
