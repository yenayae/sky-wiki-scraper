==Memory==
<div>
{{#ev:youtube|RLA-vDpm0R0||inline|Valley Elders Cutscene}}
The Valley Elders' memory begins the camera panning up to show the temple and coliseum.

The child (you) turns around to see a figure standing alert in the distance, holding a radiant stick to their side. The Twins step apart in an theatrical reveal and show off by striking their synchronized poses, twirling their paddles, and performing flips. They take a giant leap and jump over the child. 

The Twin with the bobbed hair kneels and holds out their hand. Seeing this, the Twin with the spiky hair takes a step forward to extend their hand further towards the child, but is immediately cut off by the first Twin. Using their paddle, the second Twin hits the flame out of the child's hands and catches it, while the other Twin and child follow in pursuit. The second Twin dodges a swing by the other Twin with a great leap and lobs the flame once again. The flame rebounds off the child's failed catch back to the second Twin. This short-lived game of cat-and-mouse ends with the second Twin launching the flame out of the coliseum.
