==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|zVVzjA1x4S0||inline|Video Guide}}

The Bereft Veteran can be found in the [[Repository of Refuge]] in an opening in the wall, on the player's left when entering the area. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Bereft Veteran can be seen as their younger self, standing on a ladder and hanging Chimes on the front porch of their home while their little child watches from below. As the memories progress, the child progresses from being a young kid to an adult and the Bereft Veteran gets older. The child soon leaves home on their own to become a soldier, holding a spear in their hand as they wave goodbye. On a snowy day, the Bereft Veteran sits on a chair inside their home when a soldier comes knocking at their door. They show the Veteran a notice and it is apparent that they've lost their child to the war. Filled with grief, the Bereft Veteran is left standing, crumpled over, next to the Chimes that the two installed together many years ago.

At the end of the memory, the Bereft Veteran looks at the Chimes in front of them, remembering their forever-lost child and mourning them with one hand on their heart and the other touching their forehead.

*Level 1 will make your avatar turn to the side while lowering their head and touching their forehead with their right hand and their heart with the other hand, before shaking their head a few times, while a few high-pitched xylophone notes play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with rippling circles of light glowing around the right hand.
*Level 3 will make your avatar raise their hands to their head in despair and step from side to side a few times before dropping their upper body so they stand in a semi-crouched position, while high-pitched descending xylophone notes play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a large black cloud appearing above your avatar's head when they lower their body during the second half of the Expression.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
