== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|ZX1k1hbb_sw||inline|Video Guide}}

The Sassy Drifter can be found at the far right of [[Isle of Dawn]], amongst the hills where the clouds touch the sand. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 4-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Sassy Drifter can be seen walking towards the clouds and then sits down to enjoy the scenery.

At the end of the memory, the Sassy Drifter assumes a position with their weight shifted onto the left leg and their hand propped up on their left hip, as they stare off to the right.<br>

*Standing up will make your avatar straighten their left leg while the right one is bent in a relaxed manner, prop their left hand up on their left hip, and tilt their head to the side.
*Kneeling will make your avatar squat with their legs to their chest and rest their head on their opened palms, with their elbows touching each knee.
*Sitting will make your avatar lean back on the ground, supported by their left hand, lay their legs to the right with one leg resting on top of the other, and rest their right arm on one knee.
*Lying Down will make your avatar lay on their stomach, resting their head on the propped up left arm, while their eyes are closed, and their legs bent up.
