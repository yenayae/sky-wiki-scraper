==Friendship Tree==
Unlike later Ultimate Guides, the Gratitude Guide did not have a Friendship Tree. Instead, the [[#Ultimate Mask|Ultimate Gift]] was obtained by clicking the flag in the middle of the Seasonal Constellation after completing all [[Season of Gratitude#Spirits and Cosmetics|Seasonal Spirits]]. '''Now that the Season is over, their cosmetics are no longer available.'''

==Quest Tree==
Unlike later Ultimate Guides, the Gratitude Guide did not have a Quest Tree since there were no Seasonal Quests.

==Trivia==
*The Gratitude Guide made appearances as an Event Guide called the '''Auspicious Visitor''' to offer event cosmetics during [[Days of Love]] in 2022 and 2023, and [[Days of Fortune]] in 2022, 2023, and 2024. 
*Being the final ultimate reward for the first sky season ever, the Gratitude Ultimate Mask is considered one of the rarest items in the game.
