The Anxious Angler can be found in the [[Treasure Reef]], on the far-left islands, on the opposite side of the lagoon past the [[Abyss Guide]]'s ship. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Anxious Angler, accompanied by the [[Abyss Guide]], can be seen going out fishing along the rocks. The Anxious Angler tosses a net into the water and comes up with a decent haul of fish while the Abyss Guide watches closely with a bucket in hand. The Anxious Angler then rushes ahead, leaving the Abyss Guide behind as they stretch out an arm, as if to say, "Wait up!" Now alone and vulnerable, the Anxious Angler tenses up as they realize that something sinister has drawn near - a [[Krill|Dark Dragon]], cruising along in the shallows behind them.

At the end of the memory, the Anxious Angler tenses up further, fearfully glancing over their shoulder as they anticipate the worst... but they go unnoticed by the Dark Dragon, and they heave a gusty sigh of relief.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar hunch their shoulders, loosely raising their hands to hold them close to their torso, before slowly looking over their right shoulder for a few seconds, then heave a sigh of relief while a wooden tapping sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with three white dots appearing in your avatar's line of vision and a small breath cloud appearing as they sigh.
*Level 3 will make your avatar raise their hands close to their body, slightly bend their knees, and slowly look over their left shoulder, before physically flinching. Immediately afterwards, they stand up straight, holding one hand over their mouth with the other arm crossed over their body while looking around, their head moving in a fast, choppy motion. At last, they relax. During this Level, a rattling sound builds up, comes to a halt with a sudden drum sound, and is then followed by a few dull guitar notes.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with three larger, blue glowing dots appearing in your avatar's line of vision before small blue sparkles, representing nerves or sweat, rain from their side.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
