'''Who is AURORA?'''

AURORA is a singer, songwriter and record producer from Norway, whose genre-defying music has been described as "ethereal" and "like heaven on Earth." A deep personal connection to Mother Earth and all living creatures shines through her work, which explores beauty and darkness as a way of healing and growing. AURORA's open heart and bold spirit made her the perfect collaborator with Sky, working together to create an interactive musical journey to remind us that we are all "Born Into The Light."
