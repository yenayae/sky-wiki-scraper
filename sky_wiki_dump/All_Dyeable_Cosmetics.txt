This page contains all the dyeable [[Cosmetics]] in the order that they appear in the Outfit Shrines and categorized as: [[Outfits]], [[Shoes]], [[Masks]],and [[Capes]]. 

Each dyeable cosmetic can have up to '''2''' sections. To dye each section, it will cost between 1-4{{Cost|D}} jars of dye '''if using <u>only</u> a "base" color'''. Adding an optional "tint" color will cost an <u>additional</u> 1-4{{Cost|D}} jars of the selected tint color (however much dyeing the base color costs).

This means that ''if'' using a tint, dyeing a single section could cost up to {{Cost|8 D}}.

For example, a cosmetic's section costs {{Cost|3 D}}:
* Using a red base = {{Dye|3|color=red}}
* Using a red base and yellow tint = {{Dye|3|color=red}} + {{Dye|3|color=yellow}}; {{Cost|6 D}} in total.

'''In the tables below, this is represented by "[cost without tint]{{Cost|D}} ''or'' [cost with tint]{{Cost|D}}".'''
