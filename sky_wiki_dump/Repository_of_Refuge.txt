==Overview==
[[File:Directions to repository.gif|alt|300px|thumb|How to reach Repository of Refuge]]
The Repository of Refuge sits in a forlorn corner within the Vault of Knowledge. As you descend the steps, you enter an old repository that serves as the home for the 4 Remembrance Spirits. The broken archive is surrounded by many floating platforms in an endless night where a lone manta invites players to take a ride in the starry night. Piles of crumbling diamonds scatter the area, with the [[Remembrance Guide]] standing in the middle under a tent. The Guide gives the player 10 quests each entailing a task from the Spirits to do various deeds in order to satisfy their needs. In the area surrounding the Guide are 6 Seasonal Spirits, which upon completing, will give you their unique [[Expression]].

===Child of Light Locations===

There are 10 quests, each given by the 4 Remembrance Spirits. Every time you put down an object in the Shared Space, the Spirit will nod in approval or denies in disapproval. Continue until they are completely satisfied.
