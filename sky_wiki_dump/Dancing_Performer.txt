<section begin="Summary" />The '''Dancing Performer''' is a [[Seasonal Spirit]] from the [[Season of Dreams]] who offers the {{Emote|Dancing Performer|inline_text}} Expression. The Dancing Performer is found in the [[Village of Dreams]], on the left when entering from [[Valley of Triumph#Social Space|Valley's Social Space]], under a canopy in an alley between two buildings. The collectibles [[Dancing Performer#Traveling Spirit|offered]] by this Spirit are a {{Spirit Item|Dancing Performer|Mask|inline_text}}, a {{Spirit Item|Dancing Performer|Hair|inline_text}}, a {{Spirit Item|Dancing Performer|Cape|inline_text}}, and the {{Spirit Item|Dancing Performer|Instrument|label=Lute Instrument|inline_text}}.<section end="Summary" />

== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|s2PCYNqPFBo||inline|Video Guide}}

The Dancing Performer can be found in the [[Village of Dreams]], at the end of the slope when entering from [[Valley of Triumph#Social Space|Valley's Social Space]], between the second- and third-to-last buildings on the left, under a canopy. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Dancing Performer can be seen carrying their [[#Instrument|Lute]] and a jar, making their way down to the nearby ice rink. Once at the bottom of the slope, they find the little Skater sitting in the snow by the rink with their head dropped. Seeing this, the Dancing Performer puts down the jar and pulls out their Lute to play a little tune, capturing the little Skater's attention and lifting their sad mood. With their confidence regained, they join the Dancing Performer to dance on the ice rink as the older Spirit continues to strum an upbeat song.

At the end of the memory, the Dancing Performer demonstrates a dance with sweeping motions to the applause of the little Skater, teaching them some moves to copy and learn for their final performance at the [[Coliseum]].<br>

* Level 1 will make your avatar straighten their arms at their sides, palms facing down, and begin to dance by crossing their left leg behind their right while each shoulder moves up and down. After uncrossing their legs, they repeat the movements in the reverse direction before finally finishing with a little kick of their left foot as their head tilts back while drum and snare notes play.
* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with small bursts of white sparkles appearing from your avatar's head at various moments during the dance and from the final kick, in addition to a trail of white light following the motion of their hands.
* Level 3 will make your avatar perform a dynamic dance by exaggeratedly stepping from side to side, hands swaying elegantly with the motion, before kicking up their left leg, smoothly bending down, and finally taking on an elegant pose with their hands in the air, turned to the side, and their left leg slightly crossed behind the other, while percussion notes play.
* Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with small bursts of sparkles appearing at varying moments during the dance and a sparkling trail of white light following the motion of your avatar's hands.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
