The Butterfly Charmer can be found to the left of [[Butterfly Fields]], at the entrance of a large hollow rock dome. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 3 memory fragments<ref>Memory fragment count provided by {{Userlinks|FeatheredFlight}}.</ref> and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Butterfly Charmer is seen darting around the inside of the hollow dome structure, peeking into several holes within the rock walls.

At the end of the memory, the Spirit stands at the center of the dome, admiring the numerous [[Butterflies]] fluttering throughout the air. The Butterfly Charmer then raises a hand to allow a Butterfly to briefly land on it before flying away.<br>
