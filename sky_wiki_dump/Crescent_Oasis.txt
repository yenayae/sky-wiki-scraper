<section begin="Summary" />The '''Crescent Oasis''' is a Seasonal area added to [[Vault of Knowledge]], introduced with the [[Season of the Nine-Colored Deer]] in Update {{v|0.24.0}}. All the Quests, Spirits, and activities can be found in the area. To enter the Crescent Oasis, head to the [[Vault of Knowledge#Collaboration Room|Collaboration Room]] in the Vault of Knowledge - left from where the player spawns once heading into the Vault portal. The doorway is blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring '''one (1)''' [[Regular Spirit]] from Vault to enter. Once inside, sit at the meditation circle in front of a mural of the {{Season Icon|Nine Colored Deer|inline_text|label=Nine-Colored Deer}}. The Crescent Oasis unfolds like a hidden gem amidst the vast, golden expanse of the desert.<section end="Summary" />

==Overview==
The Crescent Oasis is a picturesque landscape situated within the Painted World. The [[Spirit of Mural]] stands on the edge of the titular Oasis, in front of the [[Murals|Mural]] wall that depicts the story of the [[Season of the Nine-Colored Deer]]. Scattered across the basin are 4 [[Seasonal Spirits]] which upon reliving, will give players their unique [[Expressions]]. The Crescent Oasis is comprised up of five different sections; the Valley which is home to a [[Dark Dragon]] and is infested with [[Darkness]], the Crescent Oasis itself, the Town, the Royal Palace of the [[Feudal Lord]], and the Hidden Glade which is the home of the Nine-Colored Deer. Additionally, there is a [[Map Shrines|Map Shrine]] to be found near some withered trees on the opposite side of the Oasis. 

===Child of Light Locations===
Three (3) [[Children of Light]] have been added to the [[Crescent Oasis]] area.<br>

<!--
Potential to add sections for the main areas that make up the Crescent Oasis with descriptions and images, like those seen on the Starlight Desert page. -->

==The Royal Palace==
[[File:Wax-Crescent-Oasis-City-Mural-Outside.png|thumb|300px|Outside The Royal Palace]]
{{Quote|<br>'''Heart of the Kingdom.'''|Royal Palace Opening}}
The Royal Palace is a sub-area located in Crescent Oasis and within the Town. It is comprised of the Outer Wall, the main entrance (with an elevator), the throne room, and a subterranean cavern located behind the throne room.

==Hidden Glade==
[[File:Chat-Crescent-Oasis-Hidden-Glade.jpg|thumb|300px|Looking towards the Golden Tree inside the Hidden Glade]]The Hidden Glade is hidden among the clouds located behind the Mural wall in the Crescent Oasis. However, the entrance only becomes accessible once players complete the [[Season of the Nine-Colored Deer#Quest #5|fifth Seasonal Quest]] from the [[Season of the Nine-Colored Deer]]. The Hidden Glade is a tranquil little marsh that the Nine-Colored Deer calls home. (The Nine-Colored Deer can only be seen by those who fall into the memory of the [[Season of the Nine-Colored Deer#Radiance of the Nine-Colored Deer|Radiance of the Nine-Colored Deer]] cape). In the center lies the crown jewel of the glade, a magnificent Golden Tree which houses a [[Winged Light]] underneath its boughs.

==Trivia==
While it was a suspected bug, from Patch {{v|0.24.0}} to Patch {{v|0.24.2}}, the red candle hidden in the underwater tunnel in the Oasis rewarded 200 pieces of light, but after a rebalance patch, it was lowered to 10 pieces of light.
