<br>
The Pointing Candlemaker can be found by the [[Isle of Dawn#Sand Dunes|Sand Dunes]], just outside the caves to the left of the large ramp with the [[Spirit Gate]] at its base. They are the first Regular Spirit for nearly all players because it is effectively required as part of completing the initial tutorial. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Pointing Candlemaker is seen teaching two other Spirits about what candles are, how they are made, and what they are used for. After showing them the second cave [[Murals|Mural]] that depicts [[Isle of Dawn]] and its [[Elders|Elder]], the Pointing Candlemaker invites them to a boat waiting outside the cave.

At the end of the memory, the two Spirits have boarded the boat filled with jars and candles. The shorter Spirit raises both arms in excitement while the other Spirit claps, and the Pointing Candlemaker points towards their next destination: the [[Isle Temple]].<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar take a large step with their left foot and extend their right arm forward. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a white line following the pointing gesture and sparkles at the end, emphasizing the point.
*Level 3 will make your avatar excitedly run in place until they burst into position, by taking a step with their right foot and extending their right arm forward, then periodically glancing back over their shoulder. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
