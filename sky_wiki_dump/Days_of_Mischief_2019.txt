To celebrate the spookiest time of year, a new Halloween-inspired event was introduced to Sky. This event began '''Sunday, October 27, 2019 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended '''Thursday, October 31, 2019 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''5''' days. While this event took place during the [[Season of Lightseekers]], it did not have any tie-in with the Season. 

For the occasion, the [[Secret Area]] was decorated with patches of [[Darkness]], some of which resembled pumpkins. The sky gained an ominous red color and a large crescent moon, with several active [[Dark Dragons]] roaming outside the building. The [[Secret_Area#Founder's_Pack|TGC Cape]] NPC had been temporarily removed. Instead, there were two Halloween NPCs whose dialogue explained that new Halloween-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] were available from the in-game shop (only while at the Secret Area).

A Dark Dragon was also briefly present inside the building. Players could melt the Darkness in the left bathroom, which would cause a Dragon to burst out from inside the toilet. It would fly around outside, above the roof and in the clouds. Players needed to be cautious, as the Dragon could cause damage, like the rest of the Dragons outside.
