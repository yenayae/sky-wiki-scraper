The Star Collector can be found on the broken boat in the [[Starlight Desert#Jellyfish Cove|Jellyfish Cove]] sub-area within [[Starlight Desert]], accessed through a cloud tunnel to the left of the Garden of Roses. This Spirit has a [[Collection Memory|collection memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Star Collector can be seen dashing between the two split halves of the broken boat as stars twinkle merrily in the night sky.

At the end of the memory, the Star Collector sits at a desk covered in [[#Prop|star lamps]] and counts the many stars overhead, chuckling to themself with glee at the numbers.

The Little Prince then enters the scene and asks the Spirit, "What do you do with these stars?"

The Star Collector puts their hands on their hips, nodding as they proudly answer, "I own them. Five-hundred-and-one millions of them."

"Why owning the stars?" The curious Little Prince asks as the Spirit continues to count. 

"It makes me rich," The Star Collector says.

Unsatisfied with their response, the Little Prince questions them once more, "Why do you want to be rich?"

Chuckling as if the answer was obvious, the Star Collector replies, "To buy more stars."

The Little Prince tilts his head and contemplates aloud, "The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary."<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar hunch slightly and bring both hands up to chest level to rub them together a few times with their eyes squinted, while a light flute sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with trails of glowing, yellow sparkles following your avatar's hands, and a few small, white sparkles fizzling widely around their head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar look over both shoulders with their hands held at chest-level, before then hunching forward to rub them together next to their head with their eyes squinted, while a low flute sound effect plays.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with trails of glowing, yellow sparkles following your avatar's hands, and a few small, white sparkles fizzling widely around their head.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

=== Prop ===
The [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a gray lamp shaped like a four-pointed star, costing {{Cost|70 C}} from the Traveling Spirit.

Upon being touched on the screen, these particles will burst outwards from the touching point and slowly recover back. Other players can ''not'' see that another player has touched the particles. Note that this Prop does not illuminate the area or recharge the player's Cape. It was available to all players during the Season from the Friendship Tree's fifth node ({{Cost|72 SC|season=The Little Prince}} total).<br>

== Trivia ==
* The Star Collector is inspired by the Businessman in ''[[wp:The_Little_Prince|Le Petit Prince]]'', written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
* The Star Collector was originally called the Shrewd Merchant during [[Sky Beta|Beta]] testing. The reason this was changed is because of the antisemitic implications of the 'Hand Rub' Emote belonging to a mercantile Spirit. Interestingly, the icon showing the gesture itself and the matching Lvl. 3 and 4 animations were unchanged.
