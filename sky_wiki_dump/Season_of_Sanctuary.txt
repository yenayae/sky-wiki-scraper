The '''Season of Sanctuary '''began Monday, '''July 13, 2020''' and ended on Monday, '''September 21, 2020''', lasting 70 days. It was the sixth seasonal event in Sky since the game’s global release.

This summer-themed vacation season introduced the [[Sanctuary Islands]] to the [[Daylight Prairie]] realm, where a new set of Quests and Spirits could be found. The start of the season was also marked by Sky’s 1 Year Anniversary celebrations.

The Season of Sanctuary succeeded the [[Season of Enchantment]] and precedes the [[Season of Prophecy]].

==Sanctuary Islands==
{{Quote|<br/>'''''An escape from daily civilization|Sanctuary Islands Opening'''''}}
A brand new area in [[Daylight Prairie]] named the [[Sanctuary Islands]] has been introduced with the Season of Sanctuary. This is where the Season's activities will center and where all six new Seasonal Spirits can be found.

To reach the Sanctuary Islands, head to the Bird Nest (behind the Spirit Gate on the right of Butterfly Fields). Just beyond, there is a new gateway in the large hole in the clouds to explore.

The new area evokes the feeling of a summery island paradise – inhabited by numerous Jellyfish, Crabs, Mantas, and a group of vacationing Spirits. Fresh features include waterfalls, sandy shores, beach chairs, sea caves, and floating islands that hang in the surrounding skies. A previously unseen feature are the large geysers which litter the ground, allowing players to rocket high up into the sky, while also recharging their cape.

On the far side of the main island, players will see a mysterious stone monument which houses six broken bells. Standing nearby is the Sanctuary Guide Spirit who longingly watches over the ruined structure. Also scattered in all over this new area are eight Children of Light which may be collected. See [[#Winged Light|below]] for their locations.

==Daily Quests & Seasonal Candles==
Collect Seasonal Candles throughout the Season to trade with the new Spirits for their Cosmetics.

===Daily Quests===
In '''Home Space''', the Sanctuary Guide Spirit will offer players four [[Quests|Daily Quests]] to complete every day. Players will earn one Seasonal Candle per Quest completed. Each day the Guide stands next to a Realm's Portal, indicating where the day's Daily Quests may be completed. The chosen Realm will also contain four Bunches of Seasonal Candles. If you gather the light from all four Bunches, you will be able to forge a fifth Seasonal Candle. Players who have the [[Season Pass]] can also claim a sixth Seasonal Candle as a free daily bonus.

==Child of Light Locations<span id="Winged Light Locations"></span>==
Eight new [[Children of Light#Sanctuary Islands|Children of Light]] can be found at the Sanctuary Islands in Daylight Prairie. 

==Spirit Memory Quests ==
Find the 'Sanctuary Guide' Spirit on the main island. They will offer you Special Quests to complete. Completing each Quest will unlock a cutscene and reward you with a regular Heart.  

Players must gather '''Memory Fragments''' to help the Spirit restore the ruined stone monument nearby. The fragments are found in the form of large golden bells which are strewn throughout the islands. Embark on a treasure hunt to find them all.

</gallery>
For each Quest to find a fragment/bell, speak to the Guide at the Sanctuary Islands. You will be directed towards the fragment's location through a series of clues. 

*First, you'll receive a hint/statement about where to find a hidden mural. Near every hidden mural, there are a few White Candles that help mark its location.
*If the white candles are lit and you are near enough to the mural, it will reveal itself as a map and show you then where to locate the missing fragment (X marks the spot). The fragment you are searching for will glow a faint green.

Follow the clues to find and return all six Memory Fragments to the Guide throughout the Season and see what unfolds as you do.

===Quest 1===
This First Memory Fragment is located at the north of the area, beneath a waterfall; the clue to the location of the first memory fragment can be found in an archipelago dotted around the near-ends of the sea. When collected, the Sanctuary Guide/Ancestral Spirit uses it to summon creatures that are seen to be a group of baby mantas.

===Quest 2===
This Second Memory Fragment is located at the floating islands at the north, underneath a floating island with a large hole; the clue to the location of the second memory fragment can be found upon a large boulder in the sea. When collected, the Sanctuary Guide/Ancestral Spirit uses it to summon a couple of normal-sized mantas, from the depths of the sea.

===Quest 3===
This Third Memory Fragment is located at the bottom of the sea caves; the clue to the location of the third memory fragment can be found by following the Song of The Rivers. When collected, The Sanctuary/Ancestral Spirit uses it to summon a pair of large mantas from the depths of the sea, which players can also ride, like the ones in the Villages of Daylight Prairie.

===Quest 4===
This Fourth Memory Fragment is located behind the three stone statues next to the return home point on the main island; the clue to the location of the fourth memory fragment can be found "in plain sight" on the wall off the mountain behind the bell monument. When collected the Sanctuary Guide/Ancestral Spirit uses it to summon a giant manta from the depth of the sea. Just like the Adult Mantas summoned by the previous memory fragment and the ones in The Prairie Villages, the one summoned is a rideable manta that allows you to get to an island hidden high in the clouds.

===Quest 5===
This Fifth Memory Fragment is located in a cave near the sea caves where a star and some wax is located, the clue to the location is found at the first waterfalls where the Timid Bookworm Spirit is located. Players can reach the floating island by riding the one of the adult mantas summoned by the third memory fragment. When collected the Sanctuary Guide/Ancestral Spirit uses it to summon an even bigger manta compared to the giant manta summoned previously by the Fourth Memory Fragment, and just like the previous large mantas summoned it can be rideable to help reach the same island as the previously summoned giant manta.

===Quest 6===
This Sixth/Last Memory Fragment is located in a floating island hidden in the clouds, clue to the location is found in the cave filled with jellyfish and crabs where the Jelly Whisperer Spirit is also found. To reach the floating island use the very large mantas to fly there. When collected the Sanctuary Guide/Ancestral Spirit uses it to summon all 6 spirits to let them know that all bells have been restored and together they summon a flock of birds, baby mantas, normal mantas, and a very huge creature that is seen to be a fusion of a whale and a giant manta (or maybe an elder manta). The stone monument is now a working carillon, with six bells/notes that players can individually ring.
