<br>
The Hide'n'Seek Pioneer can be found in [[Forest's Brook]] in a cave hidden by [[Darkness|Darkness Plants]], on the right-hand side of the brook before the bridge. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 5 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. All of the memory fragments are [[Spirit Health|sheltered]] from the [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Rain|rain]].

After burning the Darkness covering the entrance and entering the cave, [[Deep Call|Deep Calling]] is recommended to flip the three [[Dark Crabs]] guarding the area, preventing them from attacking while you locate the Spirit.

As their memory unfolds, the Hide'n'Seek Pioneer is seen beginning a game of Hide and Seek with another Spirit, holding their hands over their eyes as they count down while the other rushes out of the cave to find a hiding spot. The young Spirit then begins to seek out their fellow player, darting about the Forest's Brook in a spirited hunt.

At the end of the memory, the Hide'n'Seek Pioneer finally spots the other Spirit peeking around the corner of a pavilion. Still feeling playful, the young Spirit glances both ways behind them in dramatic fashion, as if to request another game of Hide and Seek.<br>

== Expression ==
This Spirit offers the {{Emote|Hide'n'Seek Pioneer|inline_text}} [[Expression]], which has only 1 Level with no upgrades.

Instead of being a standard animation, this Expression begins a mini game of '''Hide and Seek'''. When selected, a {{Emote|Hide-n-Seek Pioneer}} Hide and Seek icon appears over your avatar's head, inviting all nearby players to join the game by clicking on the icon.  The player who starts the game is always the seeker. Everyone else is told to hide while a timer counts down to the start of the game. The seeker then has a limited amount of time to find the hidden players and tap on them. [[Honk|Honking]] and [[Deep Call]]s do not show any hidden players to the seeker for the duration of the game.<br>

* Hide and Seek will make your avatar raise both hands to cover their eyes and sway their torso side to side. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character. Exiting this Expression will make your avatar quickly twist to glance both ways behind their back.
