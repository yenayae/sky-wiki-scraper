== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|vqDrzq5MZ9k||inline|Video Guide}}

The Rallying Thrillseeker can be found in the [[Sanctuary Islands]], next to a geyser located inland on the left side of the main island. This Spirit has a [[Collection Memory|collection memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

This Spirit requires players to to use the nearby geysers to [[Collection Memory|collect]] light fragments in the air – similar to the [[Manta Whisperer]]'s memory in [[Valley of Triumph]].

As their memory unfolds, the Rallying Thrilseeker can be seen briefly jumping into the geyser.

At the end of the memory, the [[Sanctuary Guide]], Rallying Thrillseeker, and the [[Grateful Shell Collector]] watch two Mantas fly past by. They all cheer and clap.<br>
