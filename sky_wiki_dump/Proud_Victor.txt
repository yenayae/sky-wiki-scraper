<br>
The Proud Victor can be found at the top of the [[Coliseum]] stadium, to the left of the Temple entrance when facing the Temple from the center podium. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 5 memory fragments and a 4-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Proud Victor slides down the walkway in between sections of seating on the left side of the Coliseum. At about halfway down the walkway, the Spirit trips, and slides the rest of the way down the stadium and into the center ice rink. The Proud Victor then continues to slide around the perimeter of the rink.

At the end of the memory, the Proud Victor stands at the center podium, having recovered from their fall down the walkway. They look around bashfully and quickly cross their arms against their chest.<br>

* Standing will make your avatar cross their arms in front of their chest and hold their legs apart, giving them a wider stance.
* Kneeling will make your avatar sit with their arms crossed in front of their chest and with their feet and calves tucked under their thighs.
* Sitting will make your avatar sit down with their legs bent, knees facing up, and with their legs spread apart. They will also rest their forearms on their knees. 
* Lying down will make your avatar lay on their left side, rest their head on their left arm, and place their right arm over their stomach.

== Cosmetics ==
=== Mask ===
The [[Mask]] offered by this Spirit is actually a non-Mask, costing {{Cost|30 H}}. When it is equipped, you will see your avatar's bare face, blank of any detail except for your closed eyelashes. It is permanently available to all players after unlocking the Spirit's first [[Wing Buff]] and the Friendship Tree's fourth node.<br>

=== Cape ===
The Proud Victor offers two standard-style red [[Capes]]; a Tier 1 and a [[Tier 2 Cape|Tier 2]] version, costing {{Cost|10 H}} and {{Cost|30 H}} respectively. Both are permanently available to all players after unlocking the Friendship Tree's first node and second [[Wing Buff]] respectively. 

The Tier 2 Cape (and the second Wing Buff that unlocks it) are not needed to complete the Valley of Triumph [[Constellation]]. These were both added to the Friendship Tree in Patch {{v|0.12.0}} on December 15, 2020.<br>
