<section begin="Summary" />The '''Passage Stone''' is the stone ramp in the middle of sand dunes in [[Isle of Dawn]]. Updated with the [[Season of Passage]] in Patch {{v|0.21.0}} with the addition of a campfire - where the actual area is found. All the quests, spirits, and activities can be found in this area. To enter the Passage Stone, head to the middle of [[Isle of Dawn]], where a bonfire with a meditation circle allows you to rest until ''nightfall''. To unlock the meditation circle, the account would have had to progressed through at least [[Hidden Forest]]. Experience the memories of four young Spirits, and share in the passages that brought them together as they navigate their way towards community.<section end="Summary" />

==Overview==
After resting, you will wake in Isle of Dawn except in the night. The area remains the same as the daytime version, except there are stars in the sky and a camping equipment set up around the muraled monument. There are four Seasonal Spirits to find within the Passage Stone area - whom are unlocked after completing [[Season of Passage#Quest #1|Quest #1]] - which upon reliving will give you their unique [[Expressions]].

The [[Passage Guide]] stands on the left of the main campfire, embarking you on six quests. Each quest a rite that challenges initiates to build towards a goal. Every quest utilises the [[Festival Tech]] feature, allowing players to match-make with other players to do the quest together.

===Child of Light Locations===
There are are no ''new'' Children of Light within the Passage Stone nightfall area as it uses the same map as daytime [[Children of Light#Sand Dunes|Sand Dunes]]'s main area.

===Spirits in the Passage Stone===
In the Passage Stone, there are 4 [[Seasonal Spirits]] ({{Spirit|Oddball Outcast|Inline_text}}, {{Spirit|Tumbling Troublemaker|Inline_text}}, {{Spirit|Melancholy Mope|Inline_text}}, {{Spirit|Overactive Overachiever|Inline_text}})

The Passage Stone area holds the [[Season of Passage]]'s Seasonal Quests, rituals utilising [[Festival Tech]] to bring players together to build towards a goal without anyone being left behind. There are a total of 5 Quests, which are described in detail in the [[Season_of_Passage#Spirit_Memory_Quests|Season's page]]. These rituals begin at set intervals several times per hour (every 15 minutes - x:00, x:15, x:30, x:45), to allow a greater amount of initiates to participate together. These quests can be begun in the [[Passage Stone]] from the [[Passage Guide]] and later replayed in their set locations. Each ritual had a different genre, from collaboration to competitions.
