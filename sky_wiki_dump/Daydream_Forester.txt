== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|vu54MOz-zjY||inline|Video Guide}}

The Daydream Forester can be found in the [[Boneyard]], positioned around the perimeter of a small treehouse on the player's immediate right if entering from the [[Forest's Brook]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

Note that most of the memory fragments are exposed to [[Spirit Health|polluted rain]], so be sure to collect them quickly.

As their memory unfolds, the Daydream Forester can be seen trailing behind the [[Chuckling Scout]], who is gathering sticks. Daydream Forester follows the Chuckling Scout across the small stream and blows bubbles during their walk. The Forester then follows a particularly large bubble towards the edge of a small cliff at the edge of the area, not noticing the drop-off in front of them. Chuckling Scout leaps after the Daydream Forester and grabs them by the ankle to prevent them from walking off the edge of the cliff. The two Spirits recover under a nearby tree.

At the end of the memory, the two Spirits trek back to the smaller treehouse together. The Daydream Forester is distracted by another large bubble and the Chuckling Scout giggles at the sight.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar look around absentmindedly before holding their right hand up to their face to blow small blue bubbles, while gentle chime and bubbling sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with extra purple bubbles popping up alongside the blue bubbles.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean forward to blow a single large bubble, and then leap up and try to pop the bubble before waiting for it to drift closer to the ground. Once the bubble is just above your avatar's head, they will pop the bubble. During this Expression, a second bubble sound effect plays and a quiet popping noise can be heard when the character pops the bubble.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with sparkles raining down from the bubble.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
