Days of Mischief was back for a third year. The event began '''Monday, October 18, 2021 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended '''Sunday, November 7, 2021 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''21''' days. Just like previous years, the [[Secret Area]] was given a spooky makeover with more [[Darkness]] pumpkins to burn and three [[Dark Dragons]] patrolling the rooftop. Different from previous years, the usual 2 Mischief NPC Spirits were nowhere to be found: instead, a new area had been added; [[The Cackling Crab]]. Players could be teleported to that area by visiting the second bathroom inside the Secret Area's building, where a black smoke can be found.
