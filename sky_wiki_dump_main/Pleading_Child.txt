==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|78M5OvlyGBE||inline|Video Guide}}

The Pleading Child is found in the [[Repository of Refuge]], on the player's right upon entering, at the very top of the area on the perimeter after flying through the opening in the ceiling. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
As their memory unfolds, the Pleading Child goes out to play with another taller Spirit, presuembly their friend or guardian, which carries a square-shaped portable table on their back. The two Spirit settle down on the ground and begin playing with their plush toys over the table, the Pleading Child with a Crab plush, and the other Spirit with a Manta one. Suddenly, the accompanying Spirit spots two soldiers from afar, one of which points at the two and the other carrying a big spear in their hands. Quickly they are besides their targets and arrest the older Spirit to take them away, while the Pleading Child tries to go after and beg the soldiers to let the Spirit go, but they have no chance against the big soldier with the spear keeping them from following. At last, the soldiers and the other Spirit are gone, leaving the Pleading Child alone, sobbing besides their destroyed table and the plush toys laying on the ground.

At the end of the memory, the Pleading Child puts their palms together and pleads with all their might at the soldiers, but they ignore the little Spirit and leave them behind, making them realize that all their pleading has no effect. Defeated and hopeless, the Pleading Child lets their head fall and covers their face with their hands, crying.

*Level 1 will make your avatar lean forward and put their flat palms together infront of their face, before shaking their hands a bit and leaning forward even more a few times, while high-pitched ascending violin notes play with each plead.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with trails of small, glowing golden clouds following the movement of your avatar's hands, as well as a slow consistent burst of small white light particles streaming outwards in all directions from the hands.
*Level 3 will make your avatar fall to their knees and clasp their hands together in front of their face, before looking up and shaking their hands in plead, looking down and repeating the same motion, and finally looking up again and stretching up a bit, shaking their hands and pleading with all their might, while high-pitched ascending violin notes play with each plead.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a short burst of golden glowing sparkles coming from your avatar's hands at the beginning of the Expression, and a golden glowing circle appearing at their hands for the remaining Expression. 

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
