== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|Yy15It0L2mA|200px|inline|Video Guide}}

The Migrating Butterfly Charmer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on the main island, right of the [[Flight Guide]], on a ledge near a flying-boat dock. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 13-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer can be seen in the middle of a solo picnic, as a [[Butterfly]] flies onto their arm, startling the Spirit. The Butterfly flies off and the Spirit stumbles after them. After a bit of a chase, the Spirit comes across a big swarm of more Butterflies, joined by the one they just followed. Fascinated, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer follows the swarm down the hill, completely in focus. The Spirit attempts to reach the Butterflies by jumping up, but instead they stumble further down the hill, which they eventually tumble down. At the foot of the hill, the Spirit sits on the ground, dizzy from their turbulous journey, but happily surrounded by Butterflies.

At the end of the memory, the Migrating Butterfly Charmer sits on the ground while their head turns from dizzyness. They shake it out and stand back up, to surprisingly see an even bigger swarm of Butterflies flying up into the sky near them. Happy about such a special moment, they raise up their arms and take in the scenery.

*Level 1 will make your avatar slowly circle their body while trying to balance themselves with their arms, as if they were dizzy, while high-pitched swaying sound effects play. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon doing so, the avatar will stop swaying and only turn their head one last time.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a golden star and a sparkle trail replicating the avatar's circle motions above their head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar strumble forward and backward, their head and arms swaying out of balance, before they fall to the ground and stay there as their head turns around in circles, while swaying whistle sound effects play. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon doing so, the avatar will shake their head out and stand up, still a bit out of balance.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with a yellow star and two colorful glowing trails replicating the circling motion above the player's head.
<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
