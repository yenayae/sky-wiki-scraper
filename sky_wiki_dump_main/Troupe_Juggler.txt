== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|Z7NwT-3zZVs||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Troupe Juggler can be found within an open tunnel next to a two-player door, on the right-hand side of the [[Ice Rink]] in [[Valley of Triumph]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Troupe Juggler can be seen leisurely strolling all the way down to the end of the tunnel.

At the end of the memory, the Troupe Juggler whips out little spheres of light from within their Cape, first juggling two with one hand, then switching to juggling three with two hands, and finally throwing all of the spheres into the air and catching them all in a dramatic finish.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar take out spheres of light from under their Cape and begin to juggle, first with just their right hand before switching to both hands, then toss all three spheres high into the air to spin around and catch them with a jaunty pose as a rolling accordion tune plays in the background.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with sparkles popping out of the sides of each sphere.
*Level 3 makes the same motion as Level 1, with larger spheres of light and sparkles popping out the sides of each sphere.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 1, with larger spheres of light, sparkles popping out the sides of each sphere, and light particles floating up from your avatar's juggling hands.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
