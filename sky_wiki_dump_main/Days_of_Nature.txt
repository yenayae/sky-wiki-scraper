<section begin="Summary" />
'''Days of Nature''' is an annual charity event celebrating [[wp:Earth Day|Earth Day]] by highlighting real-life ecological and environmental issues that usually happens around mid-April and lasts until the beginning of May. As part of the celebrations, ''Sky'' encourages players to make a difference in the real world by partnering with charities that take concrete action to clean and protect our planet, to whom they donate part of the net profit from [[Premium Candle Shop|IAP]] sales.<section end="Summary" />

During the event, players can participate in special activities to clean up [[Darkness]] and lend aid to the various [[Light Creatures]] that inhabit the world of ''Sky''—and earn a bit of [[Pieces of Light|Light]] in the process. Alongside the Nature Guide Spirit, the [[Chill Sunbather]] arrives to wander the beach near the [[Additional Light Sources#Sunset Sanctuary Turtle|Turtle]] in [[Sanctuary Islands]] and offers returning items from previous years.

Nature-themed IAPs are available from the in-game shop, and the Nature Guide Spirit offers various cosmetics from their Friendship Tree. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy Traveler's Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] at Home, the [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Spell Shop]] in Aviary Village, or the Nature Gift Box found at the event area.

{{#ev:youtube|d4HS_RlCcHw||right|Days of Nature 2025 Trailer}}
Days of Nature returned for a sixth year! From '''Monday, April 28, 2025 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' through '''Sunday, May 18, 2025 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''21''' days. The ocean and its beloved [[Creatures#Light Creatures|Creatures]] were in trouble once more—sending a quiet plea for help that echoed across the waves. For the duration of the event, the Nature Guide stood at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to teleport players to [[Sanctuary Islands]].

It all began high atop the mountains of the Sanctuary Islands, where something felt different this year. Tiny specks of Microdarkness had begun to spread, disrupting the ecosystem by polluting the waters, and trapping the various light creatures that call it home. Each day, players could take the burden of the Sanctuary onto themselves by freeing the small creatures, and collecting [[Darkness]] by swimming in the polluted waters, then seeking out a Flame or Geyser to cleanse the Darkness.

Sky continued its partnership with The Ocean Cleanup, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ridding the world’s oceans and rivers of plastic pollution. The majority of the [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] available for purchase during Days of Nature 2025 supported real-world cleanup efforts in oceans and waterways.

{{#ev:youtube|Ec79mJGPbzw||right|Daily Ticket Guide}}
A total of {{Cost|5 T|event=nature}} Event Tickets could be forged by participating in the event activities each day. In addition, {{Cost|15 T|event=nature}} one-time Event Tickets shaped like clams were hidden throughout the [[Sanctuary Islands]]. They could be collected at any time during the event. 

The [[Darkness]] patch moved around daily. The Nature Guide would point out the location in the {{Icon|Question-mark-Ray.png}} cutscene at the bottom of their Friendship Tree. Otherwise, it could be spotted near the [[Mantas#Elder Mantas|Elder Manta]]. The bonfire locations were always nearby and corresponded to the bonus Event Ticket locations. Cleaning all the Darkness for the first time everyday rewarded players with ~200 [[Pieces of Light]] at the bonfire.

Players could also buy additional Tickets (costing {{Cost|2 AC}} or {{Cost|6 C}} each) from the Nature Gift Box next to the [[Chill Sunbather]] at [[Sanctuary Islands]].

==May 2024<span id="2024"></span>==
{{#ev:youtube|2HiAoJZhFHo||right|Days of Nature 2024 Trailer}}
Days of Nature returned for a fifth year with a call to aid a river in need! The event began '''Monday, May 27, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and continued until '''Sunday, June 16, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting 21 days. For the duration of the event, the Nature Guide appeared in [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to [[Prairie Peaks]] in Daylight Prairie.

For three weeks, [[#Shard Eruptions|Shard Eruptions]] and the Darkness they bring threaten the health of Prairie Peaks’ waters. Spirits will be on hand to build a device that keeps the corruption from spreading downstream, but it’s up to Sky Kids to capture its pollution and stop it from impacting the spaces around the river. Clear the pollution to earn [[Pieces of Light|Light]], but beware! This Shard Eruption has attracted a new type of [[Dark Worm|Dark Creature]]—one who’s not as eager for the debris to be cleared from their new home.

This year the event will again offer special [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]], both new and returning, to support charity efforts focused on real-world cleanup work in oceans and waterways. A little more than half of the total list price for each item sold will be donated. For a more detailed breakdown of the numbers, see the event blog post on [https://www.thatskygame.com/news/aid-a-river-in-need-days-of-nature-2024 ThatSkyGame's Website].

[[File:Red-Lilypad-Darkness-Plants-Prairie-Peaks-Shard.png|thumb|x150px|Red Darkness Lilypads]]
Across the three weeks of the event, [[Shard Eruptions]] threaten the waters of the mountain river in [[Prairie Peaks]], bringing with them a new type of [[Darkness]] that resembles lily pads. Clear the pollution by lifting the Red Darkness Lilypads out of the riverbed and burn them as they float on the surface of the water - but beware of the [[Dark Worm|Dark Creature]] that lurks nearby.

Once most of the Red Darkness Lilypads have been burned, the Shards will disappear and leave behind a reward of 200 [[Pieces of Light]]. While players can participate as in as many Shard Eruptions as they like, the reward can only be earned once per day.

The Prairie Peaks Shard Eruption appeared '''twice every hour''' for 22 minutes in the river at the following times:

*'''xx:08''' to '''xx:30'''*
*'''xx:38''' to '''xx:00'''*

===Daily Quest===
Talk to the Nature Guide at Home and teleport to Sanctuary Island. Walk down the beach to the left of the Guide. A porpoise is trapped in the sand by a Darkness plant. When you free the creature, it will circle around you at the spot until you press the ! button. 

Follow the creature out in the water until you reach the vortex. There are two things that you can do. To complete the "Rid the Great Vortex of waste in Sanctuary Island,"<ref>This is a reference to the [[Wikipedia:Great Pacific garbage patch|Great Pacific garbage patch]].</ref> approach the boat with the Anxious Angler.

*The spirit wonders who left the used fishing gear in the middle of the ocean?
*Left unattended, darkness will spread and corrupt the creatures of light in the ocean.
*Gather all the pieces!

Pick up 12 pieces of trash from the vortex to complete the quest.

The creature leads you to its friends stuck in nets at the surface. One by one you free them, diving deeper each time, and they will lead you to the clam which contains a lot of blue orbs.

For this event, TGC will donate 100% of the NET proceeds from the Days of Nature Turtle Accessory to [https://theoceancleanup.com/ The Ocean Cleanup].

The Sanctuary will be soaked in a gorgeous orange sunset and players will be able to help a creature from the dept of Sanctuary Islands and receive Lights as a benefit. This creature will become a '''permanent resident''' in Sanctuary, so you'll be able to visit it after Days of Nature ends. '''The event occurs for about 10 minutes, five minutes after [[Additional Light Sources#Grandma's Dinner Event|Grandma's Dinner Event]]''', '''repeating every 2 hours'''. At the same time, the Sunbather from Sanctuary will roam around for 10 minutes offering all the items from previous years.

Players are able to collect free spells of the Days of Natures items from the Sleepy Traveler's boat to try out all of the new items: (Each of these temporary spells last for 30 minutes.) ''Previous years spells are available to collect on an island with the Days of Nature Spirit.''
