The Crab Whisperer can be found in the [[Crab Fields]], inside a pipe next to the tunnel entrance from [[Graveyard]]. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

During the memory, the Spirit must be carried through the wrecked ship and up the pipes leading to the [[Battlefield]] entrance. Beware the many [[Dark Crabs]] along the route and the single [[Dark Dragons|Dark Dragon]] patrolling the shipwreck. Repeated [[Deep Call|Deep Calls]] are recommended to prevent Crabs from knocking you out of the Spirit's circle.

As their memory unfolds, the Crab Whisperer can be seen traveling cautiously across the inhospitable landscape, braving the dangers of [[Creatures#Dark_Creatures|Dark Creatures]] to search the wreckage of the giant ship. Eventually, the Spirit finds their way up the pipes that climb the back wall of the area - where at the top, the fallen body of another Spirit lies buried in the sand.

At the end of the memory, the Crab Whisperer mournfully lets out a high pitched wail.<br>

==Trivia==
*Crab Whisperer's Prop is possibly a reference to the pipes found in [[Golden Wasteland]] (such as the one where the Spirit is first found). It may also be a tribute to the Mario Bros pipes, given that Sky had recently been released on [[Sky_for_Nintendo_Switch|Nintendo Switch]].
*The Crab Whisperer Cape is featured in a piece of merch from thatskyshop, in the form of the [[That Sky Shop/Wave 2#Petal Cape Pin|Petal Cape Pin]]. It has a STAR feature which allows you to wear a Petal Cape with the friends that you're holding hands with for a limited duration.
*Some players have reported being able to protect themselves from [[Dark Dragons]] using the Crab Whisperer's Prop, but it is not a reliable method.
