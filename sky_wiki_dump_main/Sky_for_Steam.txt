==Linking your Game==
To protect your Sky account, it is important to link it to any account service provider listed below:
*Game Center (Apple platform exclusive) • Permanently Bound
*Google • Permanently Bound
*Facebook
*Apple ID (Apple platform exclusive)
*Nintendo • Permanently Bound After Buying an [[IAP]] <ref name="Nintendo Linking Helpshift Article">https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/811-how-do-i-link-my-mobile-sky-account-to-my-nintendo-switch-account/</ref>
*Huawei ID
*PlayStation® Network • Permanently Bound
*Steam • Permanently Bound After Buying an [[IAP]]
*Twitch

'''On Steam, you will not be able to link to above accounts if it was not done before on a mobile device. Subsequently you can only link to the above from a mobile device such as [[Sky for iOS and macOS|iOS]] or [[Sky for Android|Android]]. '''

Linking account will allow players to recover their accounts themselves upon re-installs or when switching devices. Keeping record of your Sky ID - Sky 'Settings -> 'Account' -> 'Account Info' - will also be a way to recover account progress. However, this requires the help of a TGC Support representative, which may take a certain number of business days. TGC will also ask players for their Sky ID if a giveaway is won. Keep in mind to keep your Sky ID safe from everybody, it acts as the key into your account. If you are contacted by TGC, ensure it is from official sources.

You may link more than one account service to your Sky account at a same time. You may also link your account service to a Live Sky account and Beta Sky account at the same time, since Live account and Beta account are separated and run independently (progress is not carried). However, each account service can only be linked to one Live Sky account. For example, you may link your account to Google and Facebook account at the same time, but you cannot link another Sky account to the same Google account.

===Accidentally creating a new Sky Account===
If you have accidentally created a new Sky Account via Steam or you have accidentally linked the wrong Steam account, follow the steps below to fix this. Ensure your original Sky account is linked with an external account (e.g Google, Apple, etc.) before starting this process!

# Grab your mobile device (ensure Sky is updated)
# Open Sky
# Log in with the problematic Steam account by tapping the ‘Sign In Method’ at the bottom
# Go to the top right-hand corner in-game and tap the cog wheel for options
# Tap Account and link it to another account (e.g. Gmail) that is not associated with your original Sky account
# In the same Account window, tap Steam to unlink it and confirm
# Restart Sky
# Tap ‘Sign In Method’ at the bottom
# Log in with a method that your original Sky account is linked to
# Go to the top right-hand corner in-game and tap the cog wheel for options
# Tap Account and link your Steam account

==In-App Purchases & Cosmetics==
The Shop on every platform have the same base prices. Independent of your OS, there will also be regional differences in pricing, though the base pricing set by TGC is, again, the same. Unlike the Nintendo Switch, candle packs bought on the Steam version will be under the same count as other devices. In addition any cosmetics will be shared among the linked devices - For example if the Steam Sky account has the Companion Cube, so will the linked iPhone Sky account.

===Companion Cube===
{{#ev:youtube|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeNTmYr0dd0||right|Companion Cube Announcement||start=56&end=60&loop=1}}
Players on the Steam version of Sky have the option to purchase an exclusive 'Companion Cube' prop for {{Cost|50 C}} from the permanent event store in [[Aviary Village]]. This can only be purchased on the Steam version of Sky. The Companion Cube is a plushie that you can hug and toss around for other players to squeeze. It is a placeable [[Prop]] that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]] as well. The cube is a reference to the game: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/ Portal] by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation Valve] where it appears. Valve also hosts the digital PC game store, [https://store.steampowered.com/about/ Steam], which is where Sky released into Early Access on.<br> 
<small>Note: Since the Companion Cube is obtained using in-game currency {{Cost|C}}, it '''cannot be gifted''' to other players.</small>

It’s all stuff in early stages so will likely change a lot before ever making it to the live version of Sky, but it’s great for hypothesizing, taking OC inspiration, or wondering just what kind of shenanigans TGC gets up to before something is ready for beta.
** TGC will share one piece of concept art a week, for four weeks.

==Trivia== 
*Players had an opportunity to try out a version of Sky on PC during August 23-27, 2023 at gamescom ahead of Sky’s official PC launch.<ref> https://www.thatskygame.com/news/new-sky-milestones-for-gamescom-2023/ </ref>
*Sky participated in the Steam Next Fest from October 9-16, 2023. During this window, all PC players could play a demo version of Sky via Steam. The main difference between the demo version of Sky available during Next Fest and the full version is that in-game purchases were not available. Otherwise, PC players were able to play the Next Fest version of Sky the same as players on mobile, Switch, and PlayStation with crossplay enabled.
