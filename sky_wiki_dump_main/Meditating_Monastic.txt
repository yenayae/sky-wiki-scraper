The Meditating Monastic can be found on a floating island connected to another by spiraling stepping stones on the [[Fourth Floor Vault|Fourth Floor of Vault]], at the statue surrounded by White Candles. The Spirit is only visible after using the {{Emote|Praying Acolyte|inline_text}} Expression from [[Praying Acolyte]] by the statue until it is fully lit up white, after lighting the White Candles that surround it. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 3 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

Note that players who have not activated the Spirit by Praying can still follow their memories, but will be unable to complete the final step and collect the Meditating Monastic's Expression.

As their memory unfolds, the Meditating Monastic climbs the spiraling stones to reach the larger floating island above.

At the end of the memory, the Meditating Monastic floats off the ground and crosses their legs to sit mid-air, peacefully contemplating the view from their higher vantage point.<br>
