*Level 1 will make your avatar rhythmically clap their hands together in front of their chest, letting their arms fall back down after each clap while subtly moving their body with the rhythm. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with white sparkles and an invisible circle with a glowing white edge appearing and fading with each clap.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lift their hands above their head before rhythmically clapping them together while stepping from side to side. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with orange-glowing white sparks and a layered, glowing white ring appearing and fading with each clap.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
