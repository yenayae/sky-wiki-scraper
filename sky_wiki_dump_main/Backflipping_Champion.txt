==Memory==

<br>
The Backflipping Champion can be found in the [[Citadel]], in one of the small outer towers to the left of the main structure, beneath an intact roof. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 10 memory fragments and a 4-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Backflipping Champion hops onto a [[Mantas|Manta]] and rides it around the main Citadel structure. The pair then pass through the large floating ring at the center of the area before heading towards the tallest towers, where the Spirit dismounts.

At the end of the memory, the Backflipping Champion warms up with a quick stretch and then performs a backflip that smoothly transitions into a proud pose as the Spirit shows off for their onlookers.<br>

==Trivia== 
*Before December 2020, the Backflipping Champion was one of two Spirits (the other being [[Bowing Medalist]]) found in the [[Flying Race]]. Players would have to fly into the Spirit during the race and could then receive their Expression at the end of the race in the [[Coliseum]]. After Patch {{v|0.13.0}}, both the Backflipping Champion and Bowing Medalist were relocated and given memories to relive.
*The Backflipping Champion is one of only four [[Regular Spirits]] (the others being [[Manta Whisperer]], [[Bowing Medalist]], and [[Proud Victor]]) whose memory has a [[Timed Memory|time limit]].
