<div>{{#ev:youtube|MWZ5RH7i5zM||inline|Video Guide}}

The Thoughtful Director can be found on the [[Vault of Knowledge#First Floor|First Floor]] of the [[Vault of Knowledge]], behind the four-player door to the right of the elevator. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
In order to open the door on the Vault's First Floor, players will first need to unlock the {{Emote|Telekinesis|inline_text}} Expression from the [[Levitating Adept]]. Four players are needed to open the gate and once all four are present, interact with the {{Emote|Levitating Adept}} Telekinesis prompt on the stones in front of the door together to unlock the room beyond it.

As their memory unfolds, the Thoughtful Director can be seen making their way through the tunnel behind the 4-player door and into the open room beyond it, entering a closed door tucked into the back-left corner. Light the two braziers sitting in front of the door to open it. The Spirit continues to ponderously travel through the winding tunnel and meets the [[Praying Acolyte]] kneeling in prayer along the way, who joins their journey onwards. Near the end of the tunnel, the two Spirits meet the [[Polite Scholar]] and together, the three Spirits walk the last few steps to the ledge overlooking the open room.

At the end of the memory, the Thoughtful Director looks out into the large open room where their memory began, back turned to the player. They bring a hand up to tap at their chin, swaying side to side and lost in their thoughts.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar look up slightly, bring their right hand up to their chin and hold the elbow with their left, before turning their body from side to side a few times and tapping their chin with the right hand, while two xylophone sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a big glowing question mark appearing over your avatar's head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar bring their right hand up to their chin and loosely hold the elbow with their left, before looking down with their knees bent, head turning from side to side before straightening and raising their right hand in the air in epiphany, while three xylophone sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a big glowing light bulb symbol appearing over your avatar's head as they raise their arm.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
