**🕯️ What to Prepare 🕯️
**✧ Bingo cards
**✧ Choose about 50 Sky items, spells, spirits, etc and number them.
***! You can, of course, use the example table.<br>The more you have, the more difficult it may be to get a Bingo.
**✧ Writing instruments
**✧ It might be a good idea to think of your favorite memory of Sky, your favorite place, or an item you have always dreamed of!
**How to Play
**1. Choose the starting player or order.
**2. Write the numbers of your favorite items from the list of items onto the card.
***! Make sure that all the squares are numbered differently.<br>You can put them in any order you like, or selecting the ones that are easy to Bingo.
**3. Make sure everyone has filled in all their squares.
**4. Starting with the first person: 
***a. Select a number of your choice and announce it.
***b. Share a memory or thought about the chosen item.
**5. If you have the announced number written down, mark that square.
**6. Continue announcing numbers in order until someone gets a Bingo.
**Aim for 2 Bingos, designate the next person instead of taking turns<br>Talk about your memories of the chosen number and try it while playing Sky, etc.<br>Arrange it however you like and have fun with it.
