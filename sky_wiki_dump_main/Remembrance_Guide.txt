===<span id="Ultimate Neckpiece">Remembrance Ultimate Neck Accessory</span>===

===<span id="Ultimate Prop">Remembrance Ultimate Prop</span>===
The Remembrance Ultimate [[Prop]] is a light that projects [[mantas]] flying in a starry night. After the Prop is placed, lit, and activated, it will significantly darken the surrounding area (including light sources), and produce 4 to 5 mantas of varying sizes, along with particles akin to those produced by the [[Star Collector]]'s prop, except far more widespread and plentiful. The Mantas are able to slightly lift players in the air and recharge their light. When carried, the Prop appears in its original, unlit form on the player's back. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item, available for {{Cost|2 SH|season=Remembrance}} after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node.<br>

==<span id="Props"><span id="Prop">Additional Props</span></span>==
This Season introduced a new line of [[props]] to collect from the Remembrance Guide after finishing quests. These can be redeemed by spending {{Candle}} [[Currency#Candles|regular candles]] or {{Heart}} [[Currency#Hearts|hearts]] through the Remembrance Guide's [[#Quest Tree|Quest Tree]]. All of these Props are placeable and can be used in [[Shared Spaces]].<br>'''All items remained in the Season Guide Tree after the Season ended.'''

===Chimes Prop===
The Chimes [[Prop]] is a metallic decoration with two big chimes and two small chimes attached to a silver bell shape. At the bottom, the chimes each have a little white, metallic feather. The Chimes Prop is available for {{Cost|30 C}} after completing the [[Season of Remembrance#Quest #2|second Quest]].<br>
<br>
This Prop should be placed where it can hang freely, such as on a wall or ceiling. Touching the chime will cause it to move and produce several chime notes. When placed in a windy location, the chimes will move with the wind and notes will be heard. When carried, it appears in its original form on the player's back.<br>

===Kettle Prop===
The Kettle [[Prop]] is a brass tea kettle on a stone table with a stovetop and can be used in your [[Shared Spaces]]. This Prop is available for {{Cost|50 C}} after completing the [[Season of Remembrance#Quest #4|fourth Quest]].<br>
<br>
It is a chat object for four players. Lighting the flame in the kettle stand will trigger a small animation, with the kettle vibrating and whistling while steam comes out of its spout, mimicking boiling tea. After the animation ends, the four small teacups on the edge of the stand can be used to drink tea from.  Once the tea icon appears, your avatar will start drinking tea and you should be able to '''chat''' with your friends or strangers.  The chat function is very sensitive so make sure you don't move once you activate it, as this chat object does not work like other chat props, since there are no seats. ''Note: The flame will not recharge your wings once the tea is ready!'' When carried, the Prop appears as a miniature version on the player's back.<br>

After placing the Prop, it can be picked up, held, and hugged by any player, which produces a squeaking sound; additionally, it can be thrown into the air by [[Deep Call|Deep Calling]] <ref name="identifier"> On May 31, 2023, an update was released that let players interact with plushies in form of hugs and more.
