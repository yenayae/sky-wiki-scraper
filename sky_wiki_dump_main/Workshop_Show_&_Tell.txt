<section begin="Summary" />From '''Monday, June 23, 2025 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' through '''Sunday, July 6, 2025 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''14''' days. Players were invited to slow down to relish the act of creating during Sky’s newest event. For the duration of the event, the [[Nesting Guide]] stood at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to teleport players to the [[Nesting Workshop]].

Inside the Nesting Workshop, a new glass display containing a [[Currency#Hearts|Heart]] appeared, interacting with it would play a cutscene. The cutscene encouraged players to create a [[Shared Memories|Shared Memory]] by using the free [[Blessings (Spells)|Spell]] offered at the front counter. After publishing a Shared Memory, the glass display would open, allowing for the Heart to be collected. Watching others Shared Memories inside the Workshop rewarded [[Pieces of Light]].

Seven new [[Props]] debuted during this event, and were available at the [[Nesting Workshop|Nesting Workshop's front counter]] for in-game currency.
