In the game, there are 3 identities: a Child of Light, a Prophet and a Child of the Dark Dragon, the Childs of Light and the Prophet must work together to find and vote out the Child of the Dark Dragon to win, while the Child of the Dark Dragon has to attack and knock out the Childs of Light and the Prophet to win.

During Nightfall, everyone automatically uses the Hide and Seek Emote for 20 seconds before waking up, during this time, except the first night, the Child of the Dark Dragon may choose a target to attack by selecting the Krill button in the lower-right corner and tapping the icon above the player they wish to attack.

The Prophet can also use their role during the night to inspect a player so they can find out whether they are a Child of Light or a Child of the Dark Dragon by selecting the Eye button in the lower-right corner and tapping the icon above the player they wish to inspect.

When the Countdown ends and daytime arrives, if the Child of the Dark Dragon has attacked during the night, a red spotlight will appear on the player that was attacked by the Child of Dark Dragon and will turn grey, players will then take turns speaking on who they think the Child of the Dark Dragon is, once everyone has finished speaking, players will then vote on who they think the Child of the Dark Dragon is by pressing the Point Button in the lower-right corner and tapping the icon above a player to vote, voting a player will put a flag above their head, the more flags a player has, the more likely they'll be voted out, the player with the most flags above their head will be voted out and turn grey, after which the game will continue until the Childs of Light and the Prophet have found and voted out the Child of the Dark Dragon, or if the Child of the Dark Dragon attacks all of the Childs of Light and the Prophet.
