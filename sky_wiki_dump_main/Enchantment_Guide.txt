==Trivia==
* The Enchantment Guide can be found in Aviary Village's [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Spell Shop]] but cannot be interacted with.
* The Enchantment Guide is the very first [[Ancestors#Guides|Seasonal Guide]] to offer Seasonal Quests for players to complete, and the first to remain present in the game after their Season ended.
