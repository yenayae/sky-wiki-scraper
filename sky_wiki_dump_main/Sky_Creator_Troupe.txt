Get ready for Five Days of Feast with Sky Creator Troupe, celebrating kindness and friendship in the Sky community! 

For [[Days of Feast]] 2023, members of the Creator Troupe created and posted Shared Spaces. Each Shared Space will tagged a Troupe member and welcomed all Sky kids in for a visit. 

In addition to that, Troupe members offered free redemption codes for special packs of Days of Feast-themed spells. Participating Creator Troupe members shared these codes in the channels where they stream or post their content. The first 2023 players to redeem each code received a pack with a variety of spells specially added for celebrating Days of Feast. 

The redemption code for each Sky Creator Troupe member is listed below.

==AURORA Encore Concerts==
During the [[AURORA_Encore_Concerts#Record_Breaking_Concert|Guinness World Record]] attempt on August 25, 2023, the names and chats of Creator Troupe members were visible to all players attending the Concert.  

==FAQ==
The information below has been taken from the official announcement made on [https://www.thatskygame.com/news/announcing-the-sky-creator-troupe/ TGC's website]. 

===How do I join the Creator Troupe program?===
If you're interested in joining, you can submit an application [https://forms.gle/9ndRjFH2jm19fgXMA here]! Applicants who are invited to join will be contacted directly by staff members. Ideal candidates who want to be considered for the program should post 3 or more pieces of original Sky: Children of the Light content per month, as well as follow community guidelines and the gameâ€™s Terms of Service.

===What is considered a piece of Sky: Children of the Light content?===
Any Sky: Children of the Light video, stream, or edited video content, as well as relevant social media posts with original content. Ideal candidates will maintain a larger ratio of media (video/photos/streams) content vs. text-based content or Instagram stories. 

===What about other types of content?===
We are looking into future activations with digital artists, static guide content, and more! Please keep an eye on official channels for announcements.

===What are the benefits of the Creator Troupe program?===
The Creator Troupe program provides early access to information about Sky content, as well as exclusive opportunities for things such as rewards for creators and their communities, promotion from official Sky channels, and more. 

===Do I have to post exclusively Sky content?===
No, not at all! Creators are welcome to post content from other games. However, please note that you cannot be enrolled in a competing partner title/program for another game if you are a Creator Troupe member. 

===Is this a paid opportunity?===
This is an unpaid program and does not constitute employment with TGC. 

===Do I have to sign any contracts?===
Members are required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in order to protect unreleased content and other confidential information that may be shared.
