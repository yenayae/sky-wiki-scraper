The Pouty Porter can be found at the far end of [[Forest's Brook]], in the entrance of a tunnel to the left of the bridge. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. All of the memory fragments are [[Spirit Health|sheltered]] from the [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Rain|rain]].

As their memory unfolds, the Pouty Porter is seen picking up a heavy ball and laboriously carrying it through the tunnel, carefully navigating over obstacles along the way. Eventually, they arrive at the opening on the other side.

At the end of the memory, the Spirit bends over to try picking up another heavy object. When they fail, the Pouty Porter angrily stomps their foot before crossing both arms over their chest and turning away.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar stomp their left foot while angrily bringing down their clenched fists to their sides.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with sparkles following your avatar's hands and a pink popped vein symbol by their head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar first stomp their left foot and then stomp the right foot, while angrily bringing down their clenched fists to their sides both times.

==Cosmetics==

===Cape===
The Pouty Porter offers two standard-style teal [[Capes]]; a Tier 1 and a [[Tier 2 Cape|Tier 2]] version, costing {{Heart|20}} and {{Heart|60}} respectively. Both are permanently available to all players after unlocking the Friendship Tree's fifth node and second [[Wing Buff]] respectively.

The Tier 2 Cape (and the second Wing Buff that unlocks it) are not needed to complete the Hidden Forest [[Constellation]]. These were both added to the Friendship Tree in Patch {{v|0.12.0}} on December 15, 2020.

Note that while the Capes' color is very similar to the special [[Beta Cape]] and [[Founder's Pack|Founder's Cape]], the Pouty Porter's Capes do not grant the wearer any ability to open Cape-locked [[Constellation Gate]]s.<br>
