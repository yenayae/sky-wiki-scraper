==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|IfokV7jUPZ4||inline|Video Guide}}

The Wounded Warrior can be found in an opening in the wall behind the Remembrance Guide. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Wounded Warrior can be seen at the war with another soldier. Their first battle is triumphant and they celebrate by waving their spears in the air and doing high fives. Along the way, they stop at a merchant. While the Wounded Warrior is selecting a potted plant to take home, they are attacked by two other enemies. Spears send pots flying everywhere, also killing the merchant instantly. The last scene shows the Wounded Warrior looking at the innocent deceased merchant, while the other compatriot encourages them to leave the scene.

At the end of the memory, we can see a scene closer to the Wounded Warrior, kneeling and wounded, watching the disaster they have just witnessed, the death of an innocent, caught in the wrong place, at the wrong moment.
