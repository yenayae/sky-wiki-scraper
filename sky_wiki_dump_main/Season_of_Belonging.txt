==Welcome==
<center class="title-text-welcome">[https://thatgamecompany.com/season-of-belonging-arrives-in-time-for-the-holidays/ Welcome to the Season of Belonging!]</center>A family of six Spirits will make their way to the kingdom of Sky! The Spirits have been scattered across the Kingdoms of Sky, but now they need your help bringing the family back together. Why don’t you grab a friend or two and explore all six Sky kingdoms to discover where each Spirit went?

A number of changes were introduced with this season:
*Players no longer required the Adventure Pass to obtain 4 Daily Tasks
*The [[Seasonal Spirits]] arrived one by one into the realms once a week, rather than all at once. The previous Spirits remained as the new ones were added, so by the sixth week all six Spirits were present.
*[[Currency#Season Hearts|Seasonal Hearts]] were introduced. At the end of each Spirit Friendship Tree (the highest node) players with the Adventure Pass could unlock a Seasonal Heart with a number of Seasonal Candles. This new currency was used to obtain the Ultimate Gift.
*One new area was added to every Realm except [[Daylight Prairie]] and [[Eye of Eden]].

==Newly Added Areas==
The Season of Belonging brought 5 new areas, a [[Isle of Dawn#Butterfly Cave|Butterfly Cave]] in Isle of Dawn, the [[Underground Caverns]] in Hidden Forest, the [[Valley of Triumph#Temple Maze|Temple Maze]] in Valley of Triumph, the [[Golden Wasteland#Points of Interest|roasting crabs]] in Golden Wasteland and [[The Archives]] in Vault of Knowledge.
*The side-area in Isle of Dawn (to the right of the Temple) got updated to be more spacious, with a 2-player door, a small multiplayer door and various pots; the Butterfly Cave.
*A new area in Hidden Forest - the Underground Caverns. Found in Sunny Forest, the entrance needs two players to simultaneously use the "Angry" Expression on a trapdoor.
*A new area in the Temple of Valley of Triumph. The Spirit Gate at the entrance required players to have collected two other Belonging Seasonal Spirits at the time of the season.
*A new campfire with a rotating spit of roasting Crabs was added to Wasteland's Graveyard.
*A new area in the Vault of Knowledge - The Archives. To reach it, players would first need to open a 2-player door, and then pass through a Spirit Gate requiring the player to have collected one Regular Vault Spirit.
