<br>
The Scaredy Cadet can be found to the right side of [[Forest's Brook]], just past the pavilion with the Message Shrine. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

Note that some fragments are exposed to the [[Spirit Health|polluted rain]], so be quick to collect them.

As their memory unfolds, the Scaredy Cadet and the [[Marching Adventurer]] can be seen working together to build a hammock. They appear to be short of a few pieces, and the Adventurer encourages the Cadet to venture through the Forest's Brook to go find more supplies. The two Spirits walk along the Brook until the Adventurer spots some extra hammock parts on the other side of the water. The Adventurer crosses the Brook with ease, while the Cadet remains on the opposite side, frightened of the water.

At the end of the memory, the Marching Adventurer beckons to the Scaredy Cadet, encouraging them to cross the Brook. The Cadet dips one foot into the water, but quickly pulls their foot out and shakes the water off of it.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar slowly extend their right hand before quickly pulling it away and shaking it rapidly, only standing on their left foot as they shake your hand. While your avatar slowly sticks their right hand out, a string crescendo plays in the background, and when they pull their hand away, the crescendo breaks into a loud but quick horn accent.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with white light particles flicking out from your avatar's hand as they pull it away, as well as white trails of light following the motion of their hands as they go to stand up straight again.
*Level 3 will make your avatar step forward tentatively with their right foot before quickly pulling their foot back towards their body, quickly hopping from foot to foot and shaking their head from side to side afterwards, before shaking their foot as though something were stuck to it. Similarly to Level 1, a string crescendo will play as your avatar sticks their foot out, continuing until they pull it away. At this point a similar but louder horn sound effect will play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with white light particles flicking out from your avatar's foot as soon as it touches the ground, right before they pull it back. 

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

=== Prop ===
The [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a blue hammock, costing {{Cost|55 C}} from the Traveling Spirit. It is a placeable Prop that can be used in [[Shared Spaces]]. It is a one-person chat item, which means that used by itself it does not allow players to chat, but when placed near a chat table (or any other chat Prop) it allows someone sitting in the hammock to join the conversation at the table. 

It appears as a disassembled hammock with the fabric tied to several sticks on its owner's back when carried. It was available to all players during the Season from the fifth node ({{Cost|50 SC|season=Assembly}} total).<br>

== Trivia ==
* When the [[Village Theater]] was first released, the Scaredy Cadet could be seen floating very high in the air above the theater. It was not possible to interact with the figure in any way because it was located outside the wind walls.
* The Scaredy Cadet hosted the [[Spring Camping]] Event in 2024, guiding players in Aviary Village to the Event location.
