The Provoking Performer can be found to the left of the [[Forest's Brook]], in a tunnel entrance on ground level, semi-hidden between trees. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 5 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Provoking Performer can be seen dancing their way through the tunnel, striking a final pose at the end. 

To collect the last memory fragment, the player will have to step outside and walk over under the tree quickly, or else the poulluted rain will extinguish the Spirit's light.

At the end of the memory, the Provoking Performer lifts their arms, steps forward with one leg to the player, swings one outstretched arm around, and rolls their head.<br>
