[[File:All About Spell Shops New.png|thumb|336x336px|Infographic by clement8978 on Discord]]'''Spell Shops''' are locations where players can obtain [[Blessings (Spells)]]. Each Shop offers certain Spells, which are available either daily or every weekend, from Friday through Sunday. Spell Shops refresh with the daily reset each day.
==Forgotten Ark Shops==
After restoring the [[Golden Wasteland#Forgotten Ark|Forgotten Ark]] by completing all of the [[Season of Enchantment|Enchantment Light Quests]], players unlock permanent Shops, where bundles of specific Spells, Potions, and Scrolls may be bought for a variety of Currencies. These Spell Shops made many existing Spells available permanently and introduced entirely new Spells like the Grow Spell, the Tiny Spell, and the Huge Spell.

Each Spell is sold in one of three small Shops and can be bought at most once per day. Some Spells are available to buy every day, while others are only available for three days a week, from Friday through Sunday.<br>

==Event Spell Shops==
While Spells for new items introduced during [[Special Events]] can typically be found in the Forgotten Ark or Sleepy Traveler's Boat, Spells for returning items are often found in small Spell Shops near Event Guides or in areas like the [[The Cackling Crab|Cackling Crab]] or the [[Secret Area]]. Although some Event-related spells in these shops cost Currency and can be bought daily, most of the free Spells available during Events can be obtained at most once per week and refresh on Mondays.

Event Spell Shops have taken a number of forms, from a large gift box to a wandering crab.<br>
