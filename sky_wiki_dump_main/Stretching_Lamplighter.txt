== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|lUNfBOpnDIk||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Stretching Lamplighter can be found in the [[Starlight Desert]], in the left front hole of a giant lamp tower hidden in the clouds, towards the left side of the area. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Stretching Lamplighter can be seen stretching before running about the lamp with a long, blue pole in hand, repeatedly turning the light on and off. Eventually they pause to take a break from their tireless work, pole leaning against the wall as the Spirit bends over their knees to catch their breath.

At the end of the memory, the Stretching Lamplighter straightens to stretch their arms out forward and then backwards. The Little Prince enters the scene and exclaims, "You look exhausted! Why do you keep turning the light on?"

The Spirit continues to stretch as they explain, "I have an order to turn the light on when it is off."

Head tilting with confusion, the Little Prince asks, "Then why do you turn it off after turning it on?"

"I have another order to turn the light off when it is on," the Stretching Lamplighter replies.

"Then you are unlucky," concludes the Little Prince with a hand to his chin.

The Stretching Lamplighter continues to stretch out their sore muscles, unbothered by their endless task. "Orders are orders."<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar stretch their arm across their neck by bending one arm around their neck and holding its upper part with their other hand, repeat it on the other side, before twisting their upper torso to one side, then the other, while a squeaky sound effect followed by simple guitar strums plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a trail of glowing, golden sparkles following the movement of each of your avatar's hands.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean backwards with both hands holding their lower back, before falling into a sideways crouch to first stretch their left, and then the right leg, and finally crouch down, and push themselves up straight with their hands supporting their weight on their knees, while a deeper squeaky sound effect followed by jaunty guitar strums plays.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, a trail of glowing, golden sparkles following the movement of each of your avatar's hands.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
