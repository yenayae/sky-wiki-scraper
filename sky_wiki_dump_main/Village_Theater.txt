==The Stage==
The Village Theater features a stage, which allows players to roleplay and produce shows by using various backstage controls unlocked by completing Performance Quests from the Performance Guide. On this stage, all privacy barriers are removed, meaning players in the audience see all players on the stage without lighting them and text by any players on the stage is public to players sitting on the audience benches.

Behind the Theater are a number of backstage controls that are enabled by completing the first Seasonal Quest after visiting the Season Guide. 
[[File:Village Theater Backstage Controls.png|alt=Backstage controls and options for the Village Theater|thumb|300x300px|Village Theater Backstage Controls]]

These include (facing from backstage out to the "house"):

* Curtain control: a lever to raise/lower the curtain
* High left above stage: Backdrop control with 6 stage backdrop/prop sets, one for each realm of Sky, plus a blank backdrop
* Above front of stage: audience prompter with 5 expressions - The Spirits in the audience will automatically react with these expressions when triggered, and player participants will see an expression icon they can tap to use the expression
* Right of stage next to stage entrance: Earthquake control to shake stage and tumble rocks
* Left of stage next to stage entrance: Front Stage effect, with Fire, Waves, and Fog
* Left next to closet: house lights: this turns on lights backstage and also lights around the front of the theater, helping to call attention to a performance about to start.
* High Right above stage: Wind machine
* Platform above Closet Space: Spotlights: 3 on/off levers for Left, Center, and Right spotlights
* Platform behind/above Spotlights: two levers to raise and lower groups of blocks on stage to make simple scenery
* High right rear: Effects including rain, snow, falling petals, and red and blue sparks

After completing the second quest, players have access to the '''Narrator's chair''' and the '''Daily prompter'''.  

* The Narrator's chair will position your Sky kid behind the scene and let you whisper the "line" to your actors or give direction to those on the stage. This text is not visible to the audience, only to those on the stage. 
* The Daily prompter will give you advice or ideas for your play.

There is also a [[Closet Shrine]] backstage that facilitates changing costumes and props for a performance. 

After the completion of the third seasonal quest, two instruments are available for player use in the theater area: an [[Pleaful_Parent#Instrument|acoustic guitar]] and a [[Prophecy_Guide#Prophecy_Drum|drum]].

On the stage, all privacy barriers are removed, meaning you now see all players without lighting them and your conversations are now public. Players sitting on the audience benches can also see you and your conversations as well. It's a great way to introduce yourself to potential new friends but also to facilitate the act you're taking part in.
