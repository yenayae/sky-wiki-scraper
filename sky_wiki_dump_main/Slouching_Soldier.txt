== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|_1qdnIb1y94||inline|Video Guide}}

The Slouching Soldier can be found to the player's immediate right in the [[Starlight Desert]]'s giant jar, that is found to the right of the entrance from the [[Vault of Knowledge]]. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Slouching Soldier recalls several events in their life that lead them to drink dark water in a jar to cope. 

First, the Slouching Soldier stumbles with their left hand outstretched in front of a group of other Spirits standing on a hill: the [[Saluting Captain]], [[Backflipping Champion]], and [[Fainting Warrior]]. The Soldier then stands on that same hill, holding a jar. They walk back down the hill and hunch over their dropped jar.

Over on the next hill, the Slouching Soldier runs over to a few Star Lamps as offered by the [[Star Collector]]. The Spirit sits where those Star Lamps once were, burying their face into their arm. They stumble along with a jar in hand.

Once again, the Soldier flounders towards a scene at the top of the largest hill. At the top, a parental Spirit stands with two scared Spirit children, one in each arm. The Soldier carries another jar. 

At the end of the memory, the Slouching Soldier flings the empty jar to the ground and drops to their knees and hands.

The Little Prince enters the scene and asks, "Why are you drinking the dark water?"

"So that I may forget," the Soldier replies, without looking up.

"Forget what?"

"Forget that I am ashamed."

"Ashamed of what?"

The Slouching Soldier stands up, covers their face, and runs off shouting, "Ashamed of drinking the dark water!" 

The Little Prince watches on as the Soldier grabs another jar and contemplates aloud, "Grown-ups are certainly very, very odd." The jar is tossed aside and the Soldier slouches in despair.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar slouch by hanging their head and dangling their arms, before looking up to the left once, and going back to slouching again, while melancholy accordion sound effects play. Your avatar will stay in this slouching position until they are moved.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a brightly glowing, translucent blue circle appearing around your avatar's head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar slouch to the side with their head hanging and arms swaying, sway back and forward once, and finally let themsleves fall forward with their face down, while more elongated melancholy accordion sound effects play. Your avatar will stay in this lying position until they are moved; upon doing so, they will fully push themselves up with their hands, still swaying a little once they stand.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a few small, white sparkles spiraling around your avatar's head, as well as a trail of small, white sparkles following the motion of their head while they are falling and standing up again.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

== Trivia ==
* The Slouching Solder is inspired by the Ashamed Man in ''[[wp:The_Little_Prince|Le Petit Prince]]'' written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
* The last hint in the first visit translates to, if interpreted correctly and through the strange text, is “But in order for you to see clearly whence all this mistaken idea was born, which gives rise to accusation, pain, and praise of punishment, I will lay open the whole matter and explain the very things which were said by that inventor of truth and, as it were, architect of a blessed life.” in Latin. This text is a variation on the famous ''[[wp:Lorem ipsum|Lorem ipsum]]'', which is a placeholder text used in publishing and graphic design.
