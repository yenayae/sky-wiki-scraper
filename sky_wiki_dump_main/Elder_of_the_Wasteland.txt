==Memory==
<div>
{{#ev:youtube|YIdxCjG_wWg||inline|Wasteland Elder Cutscene}}
The mighty Elder, wielding a spear and shield, jumps down from high above and lands next to the small child (you). The Elder thrusts their spear and swings their shield. With a final swing of the spear, the Elder collapses to the ground. The child walks over with flame in hand and places it on their spear. The spear begins to glow and the Elder uses it as support to stand back up. Their robes begin to illuminate as they wave their spear upwards, ejecting the flame into the sky.
