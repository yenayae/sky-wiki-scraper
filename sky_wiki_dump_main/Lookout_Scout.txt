The Lookout Scout can be found in the [[Battlefield]] inside the large broken fortress, at the bottom of a broken wall towards the left. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 6 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Lookout Scout climbs across the rubble of the fortress, carefully making their way up towards the peak of the structure, until they finally arrive at the tallest point. 

At the end of the memory, the Lookout Scout peers upon the horizon with their hand shading their eyes, before turning around and sounding a call with their horn.<br>
