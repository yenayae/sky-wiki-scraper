[[File:Child of light.png|thumb|right|x200px|A Child of Light]]
'''Children of Light''' are glowing characters scattered throught the [[Realms]], which grant the player [[Winged Light]] upon collection. They look like capeless Sky Kids, which are bright white with a golden glow, and are highlighted by a light halo, which makes them easy to see from afar. For each Child of Light, a [[Winged Light]] can be collected, by selecting their {{Icon|Hand-with-star-icon.png|link=|label=hand with a star|Inline_text}} icon when close to them. Although TGC has referred to them as "Imprints of the Children of Light,"<ref>TGC's [https://youtu.be/f0XBmzddf40?t=269 Welcome To Sky: A Traveler's Guide] video at 4:29</ref> they are most commonly just called "Children of Light".

While a few Children of Light can be found easily, many are hard to spot. Some are visible, but in a location that the player initially cannot reach. More experienced players can help others collecting Children of Light, though players can return to collect the harder-to-find ones after progressing further in the game.

Below are the locations of all Children of Light currently found in the game.

*'''Prairie WL 5''': Fly to the island to the left. Walk around to the right at the bottom of the hill to find a two player door. Both players need to hold a candle to the door to open it and reveal the Child of Light in the cave behind it. If there is no other player available, try leaving and entering the area to see if other players have appeared. If they are not near the door, release series of calls by tapping on yourself to call them over.
*'''Prairie WL 6''': Fly to the middle of the three bigger islands and walk around the back of the hill to find a Child of Light.

===Eight-Player Puzzle Area ({{#var:puzzle_area}})<span id="8-Player Puzzle Area"><span id="Puzzle Area"><span id="Eight-Player Puzzle Area"></span></span></span>===

*'''Forest WL 4''': From Forest WL3, fly towards the temple symbol (release a call to see) until you come to a bridge or go back to the first gazebo you came to in the area and follow the course of the river until you come to the bridge. When you are by the river just before the bridge, some fungi form a ladder up the bank on the left. The tree next to it also has fungi on it. Use them as a ladder to reach another treehouse platform with a Child of Light in it. ''(Note: It is easier to reach Forest WL 5 before Forest WL 4.)''
*'''Forest WL 5''': From the first gazebo, to the left, go to the next gazebo got slightly blocked behind the hill of [[The Treehouse]] door, where [[Blushing Prospector]] can be found.

*'''Forest WL 8''': Go to the stump on the left, other way of the first big pipe. There you can find a tall tower with two floors high up decent far away, The Child of Light is on the second floor. You'll need 4 Ancestor Spirits to enter, even though you can collect this Winged Light from outside the Spirit Gate.
*'''Forest WL 9''': Continue the main course. At the stilted temples with golden spires standing in the water, you can light the buttons in each of these to raise the bridge or fly to the last one that will have The Child of Light in it.

*'''Forest WL 13''': From the entrance, this is the second cave to the left, after the cave where Forest WL 14 is found. The first Child of Light is located high up in this cave above lots of butterfly jars. As with the entrance to the Caverns, players can release a deep call to reach the Child of Light. There is no need to expend flight energy at all.
*'''Forest WL 14''': This Child of Light is located in a gated area to the bottom right of the entrance.
*'''Forest WL 15''': To the left of the entrance, there is an area that can be recognized by the birds streaming from this area down into the caverns. At the very top there is a gated structure, which so far leads nowhere. There is a Child of Light standing on a pillar in front of it. For new players and those low on flight energy it can be quite hard to reach, though it may help to start from a glowing fungi across from the opening. Additionally, the birds streaming down will recharge your flight energy.
*'''Forest WL 16''': The Child of Light stands by the cavern exit, which is accessible at the top of the large hollow structure.

==[[Valley of Triumph]] ({{#var:valley}})<span id="Valley"><span id="Valley of Triumph"></span></span>==
To collect every Winged Light, players need to play the level twice as there are two different ways to the bottom.

Note: ''If you're just on a Winged Light run, you can slide down the Sliding Race until you collect the Winged Light, teleport Home, then meditate to return to Valley. Then you can back out of the Sliding Race room and return to the Ice Rink, and head to the Citadel and Flying Race.''

===Slope and Icerink ({{#var:icerink}})<span id="First Slope"><span id="Icerink"></span></span>===
As soon as you leave the Social Space, you start sliding down the hill. The slide ends at a frozen lake with a platform connected to a bridge in the middle.

*'''Wasteland WL 1''': The Child of Light is standing on a strip of land reaching into the lake in front of the fortress.
*'''Wasteland WL 2''': Above the point where you entered the realm there are some broken columns connected by a stone slab. The Child of Light is standing on top of it. It is hard to reach when playing alone, though the surrounding terrain can be used to gain a higher starting point. For instance, the mound of sand to the direct left of the landing area can be used to access the stone monument to the left of the Child of Light. From there, the player needs approximately 1-2 flaps to reach the next monument (with the Child of Light). Use the sparkle left behind by Wasteland WL 1 to recharge your cape if needed.

===Graveyard ({{#var:graveyard}})<span id="Upper Swamp"><span id="First Krill Area"></span></span>===
Enter the Fortress. Be cautious when making your moves in these areas. There is one Dark Dragon in the First Krill area and four in the Graveyard that can cause you to lose Winged Light if you are spotted (see [[Creatures]] page for details). To get to the Graveyard, slide down the hill. Don't go into the pipe to the right, it leads to the Crab Fields area. You can do either the Graveyard or the Crab Fields first. Both will lead to the Battlefield area.

*'''Wasteland WL 3''': Inside, one Child of Light is standing on a little island in the lake to the right of the main building.
*'''Wasteland WL 4''': When you are leaving the area on the other side of the lake, there is a Child of Light standing in an alcove to the right of the exit.
*'''Wasteland WL 5''': In the Graveyard, one Child of Light is on top of a hill to the right of the big bones. It may be helpful to first fly up the side of the pipe leading into the Shipwreck and then jump down on the other side to reach the Child of Light.
*'''Wasteland WL 6''': Enter the main hollow structure in the middle of the lake, the Child of Light is on the far side of it, high up on a ledge, best seen from the back of structure. One of the Dark Dragons will patrol this ledge and thus players should be cautious while recharging in the sparkle left behind.
*'''Wasteland WL 7''': Another Child of Light is in a smaller pipe-like structure to the left of the main central structure.
*'''Wasteland WL 8''': There is a Child of Light near the stairs leading into the exit (where white birds are flying) on the other side of the lake. A Dark Dragon will also patrol this spot.

===Battlefield ({{#var:battlefield}})<span id="Battlefield"></span>===
When entering from the Crab Fields, go towards the big bundle of pipes behind the wreck and climb over the top to reach the Battlefield. If you haven't done the Graveyard yet, after climbing the rocks go along the rock wall to the left until you find a cleft with birds coming out. This is the way to the Graveyard.

The Battlefield does not have any Dark Dragons patrolling initially, but when you light the button in front of the main gate of the Temple (or get close enough when it has already been lit by someone else), several Dark Dragons will be released that will roam the area. Thus it is recommended not to go anywhere near the gate until you are finished exploring the area.

*'''Wasteland WL 9''': There are two main buildings: the far away ending Temple that is still intact and a ruined fortress/temple surrounded by a moat. Climb the walls of the ruined fortress and the Child of Light is standing to the left (looking from the inside of the building) of the main tower. The easiest way up is to climb the right hand wall that forms steps.
*'''Wasteland WL 10''': In front of the main Temple there are several towers. The Child of Light is behind the tower to the right of the main gate.

===Crab Fields ({{#var:crab_fields}})<span id="Crab Fields"></span>===
In this area, also known as shipwreck, there is a Dark Dragon circling above the ship that can harm you. See [[Creatures]] page.

There are four ways to access the Crab Fields area, for two of them you will need to have found either one or two Spirits from the Golden Wasteland. 

*First way: When you exit the First Krill area, go through the Spirit Gate in the pipe to the right as you slide down the hill. This Spirit Gate requires one Ancestor Spirit from Wasteland.
*Second way: Above the previously mentioned Spirit Gate, there is another pipe which also leads into the Shipwreck area. However, this pipe may be slightly difficult to reach on your own.
*Third way: In the Graveyard area proper, go right along the rocks past Wasteland WL 9 until you find an elevated platform made out of bricks, there should be a round pipe with a Spirit Gate on this platform. The gate needs one Ancestor Spirit from Wasteland.
*Fourth way: In the Battlefield area, go to the right along the rocks/wall until you find some large pipes. It may help to first head towards the castle, and then take a sharp right. There you will find a Spirit Gate which requires two Ancestor Spirits from Wasteland.

*'''Wasteland WL 11''': Find the place where there is a tear in the hull of the ship that is spilling lots of golden jars, the Child of Light is standing on top of them, inside the ship.
*'''Wasteland WL 12''': Fly to the very far end of the area along the rock wall leading into the First Krill area, towards a tower. The Child of Light is standing opposite the tower high up in a cave in the cliff face. This Child of Light is not easy to reach without a friend (or lots of flight energy), but it might help to climb the tower and fly from there. Some players also choose to enter from the First Krill area's second entrance (without the Spirit Gate), as it provides higher starting ground.
*'''Wasteland WL 13''': Go along the rock wall beyond the shipwreck in the direction of Battlefield. Thus, when entering from Battlefield, the player should head directly left. The Child of Light is standing beyond the utmost corner of the wall, by the sea and in the vicinity of some pipes. It may be difficult to spot far away, as it is slightly obscured by rocks/pipes.

==[[Eye of Eden]] ({{#var:eden}})<span id="Eden"><span id="Eye of Eden"></span></span>==
A number of Winged Light are present in the Eye of Eden, one in the first area, and the rest just before and inside the tunnel of lights. These will help the player recover from any Winged Light lost traversing through Eden. They are available to collect before the "point of no return" i.e. before players are locked into completing Eden. Unlike all other Children of Light in the Realms, the ones in Eye of Eden are sitting on the ground or looking at it.<br><br>
