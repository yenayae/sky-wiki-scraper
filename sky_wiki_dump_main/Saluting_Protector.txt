== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|5VM8mJZVJ-A||inline|Video Guide}}

The Saluting Protector can be found in Golden Wasteland’s Graveyard Entrance, aka [[First Krill Area]], under the collapsed bell structure to the player’s left if they enter from the [[Broken Temple]]. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

This memory can be difficult to relive due to the [[Dark Dragons|Dark Dragon]] patrolling the small area in a circle. Patience is key to successfully reliving this Spirit memory, and it is encouraged to use the unlimited time limit to the player's advantage. Bringing a few friends along would be a good idea, as they can help recharge the player's Cape and can collect their lost Winged Light if they do get hit by the Dark Dragon.

Alternatively, there is a minor bug that can be used to make reliving this Spirit's memory significantly easier, especially for solo players. When re-entering the Spirit's area from any entrance into the [[Golden Wasteland|Crab Fields]], the Dark Dragon defending the First Krill Area will often fail to spawn in, removing the primary threat of the area and greatly speeding up the process of reliving the Spirit's memory.

As their memory unfolds, the Saluting Protector can be seen dancing on top of the ruined bell structures to the left, right, and middle sides of the central structure. They continue up the ruins, and continues to dance until they reach a smaller area at the top of the ruins, to the player's left. Finally, they pose at the center of the area at the top of a gently sloped ramp, their feet close together and their hands posed in front of their stomach.

At the end of the memory, the Saluting Protector commends the player for making the long trek across the ruins. They raise their left hand to their forehead and quickly move their hand forwards in a dismissive, but respectful, saluting gesture.<br>
