}}<section begin="Summary" />Based on manta rays, '''Mantas''' in ''Sky'' have been introduced as of creatures of the air but later introduced as water creatures in the Treasure Reef of [[Season of Abyss]]. In the [[Valley of Triumph]], players are able to unlock the [[Manta Call]] from the Citadel area, which does not induce any interaction with the creature but simply mimics its call. <section end="Summary" />

==Appearance==
They are predominantly white with gold-trimmed wings and tails. Many variations can be seen on Mantas, with some of the large ones on [[Sanctuary Islands]] having yellow nubs on their backs and others possessing more fin-wings. The ones in the [[Vault of Knowledge]] (see the section below on Spirit Mantas) vary the most in appearance, being semi-transparent with starlike markings. Baby Mantas are entirely white.

Despite their name, the "mantas" of ''Sky'' more closely resemble eagle rays.

== Sizes ==
With the introduction of the Bell Quests in [[Sanctuary Islands]], it has been proven that there exist different iterations of the Manta: from smaller species the size of [[Birds]], to larger Mantas nearly the size of [[Whales]], to specimens with multiple sets of wings.

== Location ==
Mantas are present in all [[Realms]], first appearing between the [[Isle of Dawn]] and [[Daylight Prairie]], and are thereafter a common sight throughout the Realms. In the [[Vault of Knowledge]] they take the form of Spirit Mantas (see below), which have a different appearance but whose abilities are similar.

== Abilities ==
Mantas have the ability to restore the player's light. Some smaller Mantas will circle around a player until their light is restored, while others can recharge players who are riding them.  

Many larger Mantas are able to be ridden, with some "kidnapping" any player who flies too close to them. Many times, riding a Manta is required (or helps) a player reach a certain area of the game, such as during the [[Season of Sanctuary]] bell hunt Quests. Mantas are also ridden to reach the Daylight Prairie's Temple.  

Large Mantas are shown to be capable of shattering rocks by hitting them with their soft-looking bodies in the fifth Quest of [[Season of Flight]], and Mantas are seen breaking out of cages during the [[AURORA Concert]].

== Remains ==
Mantas, along with [[Whales]], are the only creatures whose remains are seen in ''Sky''; their bones can be found in the [[Graveyard]] area of Golden Wasteland and the Fourth Floor of the [[Vault of Knowledge]]. The Manta skeletons seen in the Graveyard area are huge. Using the [[Manta Call]] near a skeleton in Vault will unlock the [[Spirit Manta Call]].

After completing the [[Sanctuary Guide]]'s quests and when the final bell is restored in the [[Sanctuary Islands]], what appears to be an alpha or leader of Mantas will rise from the sea. It can be seen periodically breaching the waters in the distance. Players are able to reach the creature but no interaction has been observed. Players were temporarily able to get much closer to the creature during the [[Days of Nature]] event.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/130jog3/go_see_the_whale_up_close_the_wind_wall_moved_for/</ref>

=== Spirit Mantas ===
These creatures, also known to players as '''Light Mantas''', '''Ghost Mantas''', and '''Cosmic Mantas''', are found exclusively within the [[Vault of Knowledge]], from the [[Fourth Floor Vault]] onward. They are translucent variants of the previously discussed mantas, with bright spots resembling stars adorning their wings, lined with the Mantas' signature golden trim. Like standard Mantas, there are smaller and larger variants of this species. The player can ride them to reach higher platforms, and landing on them will replenish Cape Energy. They are also seen carrying lanterns on their backs, which players must light in order to ascend to the Vault's further floors. Lighting the lanterns will result in a call from the Spirit Manta which carried it.

Spirit Mantas can also be seen in the projections from one of the Ultimate Gifts from the [[Season of Remembrance]] - a memory lantern that, when lit, summons star particle effects and floating Spirit Mantas. These can be ridden and are able to recharge the player.

Players can collect the [[Spirit Manta Call]] on the Fourth Floor of the Vault of Knowledge, which requires the player to have unlocked the [[Manta Call]] beforehand.

These appear to be a larger, more complex version of Spirit Mantas which have several "wings". They are transparent with golden rims and display a star pattern on their backs, much like their predecessors. They are found exclusively in the [[Vault of Knowledge]] and can carry lanterns on their backs. Players can ride them to reach the lanterns, and they will also replenish players' Cape Energy. Lighting the lanterns will cause the Creature to let out a distinct call. There are also two smaller Elder Spirit Mantas that fly around the large Elder Spirit Manta.

== Trivia ==

* During [[Season of Remembrance]], a plush Manta Prop was added to the game, reachable from the Season Guide's Quest Tree. It appears similar in shape to a small Manta and does not unlock any new interactions with the creature, simply being shaped like it.
* Mantas are ridable in the Daylight Prairie. 
* Mantas are depicted in several merch items from [[That Sky Shop]]. To know more about That Sky Shop products, visit their website: https://thatskyshop.com
