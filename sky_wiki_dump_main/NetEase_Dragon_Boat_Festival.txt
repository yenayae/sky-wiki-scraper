== Trivia ==

* The Dragonboat Festival 2025 Event is the first Netease Exclusive Event to use Festival Tech.
* Dragonboat Festival is to commemorate Qu Yuan, a loyal minister who drowned himself in the Miluo River as a protest against corruption and betrayal. The Dragon Boat mimics the villagers' efforts to rescue Qu Yuan, symbolizing strength and unity.
* The Dragonboat Cape used to have the same Star Patterns as other default capes. Due to the feedback from the community, it received a new Star Pattern shaped like rice dumplings and was resold again for three days from '''July 9, 2021''' to '''July 11, 2021'''.
