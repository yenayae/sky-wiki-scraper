The Season of Flight takes place in the [[Hidden Forest]]. Join a band of spirits offering gifts that echo the call of the skies, and relive their memories to see what they learned together as they charted life among floating islands.<br>

==Welcome==
<center class="title-text-welcome">[https://www.thatskygame.com/news/announcing-the-season-of-flight Welcome to the Season of Flight!]</center>
{{Quote|<br/>'''''Adventure into the clouds today...'''''}}
A brand new area to discover has been added to the game in the clouds of Hidden Forest. The Season of Flight features five seasonal quests to team up with spirits and reveal routes forward for Sky children and Light Creatures alike. Gliding aloft currents of wind, players will uncover new insight into the lives of the creatures who fly beside them—and uncover a feature that carries them from an ancient crossroads to the winds woven throughout the world of Sky; The Wind Paths.

==The Wind Paths==
{{Quote|<br>'''''Abandoned paths of the ancient kingdom.'''''|The Wind Paths Opening}}
The Season of Flight took place in an entirely new area in Hidden Forest known as the [[The Wind Paths|Wind Paths]]. The entrance to the area is through a pathway on the cloud to the right of Hidden Forest social space. Upon entering the Hidden Forest, run to the edge of social space, but instead of flying down, fly up to the right in a cloud tunnel. The doorway is protected by a Spirit Gate, requiring '''one (1)''' Spirit from [[Vault]] to enter.

{{Quote|<br>'''''Chimes guide creatures to clear passage through the realms.'''''|Restored Wind Paths Opening}}

As players restore the Wind Paths, they gain access to new wind paths that lead to different seasonal areas within each realm. The Wind Paths lead to [[Aviary Village]], the [[Hidden Forest#Underground Cavern|Underground Cavern]] in the Hidden Forest, the [[Cave of Prophecies]] in Isle of Dawn, [[Sanctuary Islands]] in Daylight Prairie, [[Starlight Desert]] in the Vault of Knowledge, [[Hermit Valley]] in Valley of Triumph, and the [[Forgotten Ark]] in the Golden Wasteland. <br>

== Daily Quests & Seasonal Candles==
===Daily Quests===
Collect Seasonal Candles throughout the Season to trade with the new spirits for their cosmetics.

The Flight Guide at Home offered players four Daily Quests to complete every day. Players would earn one seasonal candle per quest completed. Each day the quest giver stood next to a realm's portal, indicating where the day's daily quests could have been completed. The chosen realm would also contain four bunches of Seasonal Candles. If players gathered the light from all four bunches, they would be able to forge one extra Seasonal Candle. Players who had the Adventure Pass could also claim a Seasonal Candle at Home as a free daily bonus.

===Seasonal Bunches Locations===
This season, the candle bunches were found towards the beginning of each realm again.<br>

==Spirit Memory Quests==
===Quest #1<span id="Quest 1"></span>===
::'''Activate the Wind Paths'''
In this first quest, the player is tasked with unlocking the Wind Paths which connect the Realms to each other.

The Flight Guide invites them to sit in a large meditation spot, and once activated, four blue candles appear. Activating the first candle will bring the player to visit the Tinkering Chimesmith. Returning to the Main Island and activating the other blue candles will task them with delivering candles to the Talented Builder, Lively Navigator, and the Light Whisperer. Once the four candles have been delivered, the cloudy area of the Wind Paths will open up, and one Wind Path will be available to the Underground Caverns in the Hidden Forest. This Wind Path is featured in Quest #2.<br>

===Quest #2<span id="Quest 2"></span>===
::'''Rebuild the boat'''
In this quest the player is tasked with reconnecting the islands to each other.  

Visiting the Flight Guide will start a cutscene where the Talented Builder and the Flight Guide can be seen communicating with each other by signs over each other's Island. It is understandable that they want a way to travel between the islands. "The boat that connected the spirits has disappeared beneath the clouds," can be read. "Fly through the clouds to bring back the boat," as a shortcut to the Underground Cavern of Forest is seen. Use the shortcut where another meditation spot can be found and start the task to rebuild the boat by finding the missing pieces scattered all over. 

Once accomplished, the Talented Builder pushes a barge to the edge of its island, and a large Manta comes transport both the barge and the Talented builder to the Lively Navigator's island. With the help of the Talented builder, a second arch is completed. A flock of birds opens up the Wind Paths area, now highlighted by the rays of the sun. At this point, Wind Paths to Prophecy Cave (Isle of Dawn) and Hermit Valley (Valley of Triumph) open up, but a barrier still blocks the other Wind Paths.<br>

===Quest #3<span id="Quest 3"></span>===
::'''Retrieve the chimes'''
In this quest the player is tasked the retrieve the chimes. "Chimes have been mysteriously going missing lately" the Flight guide says. In a cutscene we can see a flock of birds getting away with chimes in their beaks. From the top of the Main Island, sit on the large meditation spot to start the quest. Complete the quest by retrieving all the blue chimes that the birds have carried away and return them to the Flight guide. Fulfilling the wish of the Ancestor Spirit decorates a third arch, and the Wind Paths to the final three Realms open up. The Wind Paths now connect to one seasonal area of each Realm (right to left):  

*Underground Caverns (Hidden Forest, Season of Belonging): ''Opens with Quest #1'' 
*Hermit Valley (Valley of Triumph, Season of Dreams): ''Opens with Quest #2'' 
*Prophecy Cave (Isle of Dawn, Season of Prophecy): ''Opens with Quest #2'' 
*Sanctuary Islands (Daylight Prairie, Season of Sanctuary): ''Opens with Quest #3'' 
*Forgotten Ark (Golden Wasteland, Season of Enchantment): ''Opens with Quest #3''
*Starlight Desert (Vault of Knowledge, Season of The Little Prince): ''Opens with Quest #3''

''Note: The Wind Paths are not accessible, from either end, to a player who has not completed the respective Quest above. You will either be disconnected (if going to or from) or forcibly torn away (if trying to access anything between the entrance and the quest area) from any player who has not unlocked the paths yet.''<br>

===Quest #4<span id="Quest 4"></span>===
::'''Save any trapped creatures'''
In this quest the player is tasked to save the birds trapped in the Wind Paths.

"Something seems wrong with some of the Wind Paths," says the Flight Guide. In an animation, both the Flight Guide and the Lively Navigator search for a missing boat from the Main Island. From the Wasteland shortcut, Rocks and stones blow in, and Dark Plants starts to grow all over the Wind Paths and the whole area gets under shadow. Start the quest by sitting on the large mediation circle. Once activated, strong winds start traveling all around the Island and the Wind tunnels. Navigate through the Wind Paths to save any trapped creatures. When done, return to the Flight Guide to let them know the birds are safe.  

At the end, we can see in an animation that darkness slowly takes over the passage as large stones are growing in the Wind Paths, all light fades and the sky turns green just like in Wasteland.<br>
<br>

===Quest #5<span id="Quest 5"></span>===
::'''Clear away the darkness'''
In this last quest the player is tasked to rescue the trapped mantas and clear away the darkness.

In the distance, we can see several large stones polluting the Wind Paths and mantas trapped in darkness. In order to help them, sit on the meditation circle to start the Quest.

Fly towards the Wind Paths and save the trapped mantas by burning the darkness on the large stones so the Great Manta can shatter them. Once the mission is completed, we see the Great Manta fly away with three smaller mantas, finally free, and the Winds Paths return to its original state. Return to the Flight Guide now that the Winds Paths are completely clear.

In the last animation, all the chimes are lit again and two boats with spirits from other Seasons cross the paths of the Winds Paths and start circling the Island greeting the five spirits of the Season of Flight. As their spirits disappear in 5 columns of light, we can see the Island in its magnificent original state with large mantas and flocks of birds flying everywhere.<br>

==Trivia==
*The Wind Path is inspired by [[Sky: Light Awaits#The Aviary|The Aviary]], which was an early version of [[Home]] and could only be found in Sky: Light Awaits and Sky Beta, prior to the Global Launch. With the [[Season of Revival]], [[Aviary Village]] has been added as a new Realm and an alternative to Home.
*The Treehouse is the only seasonal area of the previous seasons that doesn't connect to The Wind Path; in its place are the Underground Caverns.
*Season of Flight reuses the pre-existing wind symbol above the bell tower located inside the Sanctuary Island as its main season icon.
*Players can see a [[Hidden Forest#Easter Eggs|friendly bird]] that follows them around the seasonal area after completing [[Season_of_Flight#Quest_#4|Flight's Quest #4]].
