Aviary Village brought a new portal to [[Home]] leading to a new area that first appeared with Update {{v|0.23.0}} with the beginning of [[Season of Revival]]. It is based around the tower once present in the [[Sky: Light Awaits]] version of the game and functions as a larger and more interactive Home space. Through the Season of Revival's Quests, the village grows and develops to become a fully functioning village.

==Overview==
{{Quote|<br>'''''A hidden refuge, lost to time.'''''|Aviary Opening}}
When players first enter the portal to Aviary Village, they arrive on a dais in a place called "???". At the request of the Revival Guide, also known as the [[Hopeful Steward]], players open the gate leading further into the area. At first glance, players discover the ruin-strewn village is covered in fog, all of the shops are closed, and the [[Realm]] Entry Portals are deactivated, but through the Season of Revival's Quests, players can restore the village to its former glory.

Aviary Village is a remake of a nostalgic space well known from [[Sky: Light Awaits]] players; the [[Sky: Light Awaits#The Aviary|Aviary]], a sprawling hub space that functioned similarly to Home and also featured a tall, broken bell tower.

Once players complete the [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|third Quest]] from the [[Season of Revival]], they restore Aviary Village and the area develops into a fully functioning village. New features, shops, and hidden treasures unlock as the Season of Revival's Quests are completed. When Aviary Village is fully restored, players can also set the area as their 'Home' by interacting with a special white candle near the [[#Realm Entry Portals|Realm portals]].

After Patch {{v|0.23.5}}, some new players start their journey in Aviary Village instead of [[Home]], and they have to start the [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|third Quest]] from Season of Revival and unlock the area's [[Map Shrines#Aviary Village|Map Shrine]] to able to continue to the [[Isle of Dawn]].

===Setting Aviary Village As 'Realm Portals'<span id="Setting Aviary Village As 'Home'"></span>===
[[File:Special-Home-Candle-At-Aviary-Village.png|thumb|200px|home candle In Aviary Village]]
Upon starting the [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|third Quest]] from the [[Season of Revival]] and unlocking the Aviary Village Map Shrine, a home candle (a special white candle) appears near the Realm Entry Portals in Aviary Village and by the Closets in [[Home]]. Players can use this home candle to set Aviary Village as their 'starting point' instead of the previous Realm Portals (homespace) located in [[Home]]. If set, players will teleport to Aviary Village when using the menu's {{Icon|Icon_home.png|link=}} Realm Portals button and when opening the game.

Players are still able to return to the original Home as in Patch {{v|0.23.5}}, a new meditation circle was added on the left side of the Village Square behind the [[Shared Memories Candles|Shared Memory Shrine]].

==Realm Entry Portals==
[[File:Aviary Realm Entry Portals.png||thumb|300px|The seven portals at Aviary Village.]]
Like [[Home]], Aviary Village contains portals into every [[Realm]] in the game.

Before starting the [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|third Quest]] from the [[Season of Revival]], the player will only see the portals in an empty, incomplete form that renders them unusable. After starting the third Quest and unlocking the area's [[Map Shrines#Aviary Village|Map Shrine]], players will then see the portals activate for Realms that they have completed or are currently progressing through. Other more experienced players will seem to disappear when entering portals that the player does not have access to.

While the Realm Entry Portals in Aviary Village look similar to the ones found at Home, they are several times bigger - particularly the portal to [[Eye of Eden]].

==Return Shrine==
[[File:Return-Shrine-Aviary-Village.png|thumb|200px|The Return Shrine in Aviary Village]]
Directly in front of the [[Constellation Table]] by the [[#Realm Entry Portals|Realm portals]] is the Return Shrine. Kneeling at the Shrine, after several seconds, teleports the player to their previous location among the seven Realms. This allows players to easily finish interrupted play-sessions at a more convenient time. Unlike the Return Shrine at [[Home]], this Return Shrine doesn't have a face and is slightly smaller than its counterpart.

When idle, a faint beam of light can be seen projecting from the meditation circle in the Shrine. The color of the beam is based off the main color theme of the Realm the player last entered. For example, the [[Golden Wasteland]] results in a green colored beam while the [[Valley of Triumph]] results in a pinkish-red colored beam.

After Patch {{v|0.27.5}}, players can receive [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] from [[Player Creations]], and [[Season Pass]] holders their daily bonus [[Currency#Season Candle|Season Candle]] at the Return Shine in Aviary Village.

===Friendship Constellation Statue===
[[File:Aviary Village Friendship Constellation Statue.png|thumb|300px|The Constellation Statue in Aviary Village]]
Similar to a Constellation Table, the Friendship Constellation Statue allows players to access your [[Constellation Table#Friendship Constellations|Friendship Constellations]]. It does not, however, allow you to interact with the Realm [[Constellations]]. This statue was added in Patch {{v|0.23.5}} to provide quicker access to players' Friendship Constellations if they have set their 'Home' as Aviary Village. The statue resides in front of the Village Plaza and directly in front of where players load in. It was removed in Patch 0.28.0.

==Firework Festival Finale==
[[File:Aviary-Festival-Meditation-Circle.jpg|thumb|250px|The Firework Festival meditation circle]]
The Firework Festival Finale is a celebratory fireworks show that was introduced with [[Aviary’s Firework Festival]] and periodically allows players to enjoy a dazzling spectacle of lights and colors. After completing the [[Season of Revival#Quest #9|final Quest]] from the Season of Revival, boxes filled with fireworks and a meditation circle appear near the [[#Realm Entry Portals|Realm portals]] on the '''first day of every month,''' where players can sit to join in the celebration. 

The show starts at reset at '''00:00 PST/PDT''', then repeats every '''four hours''', and lasts around 10 minutes. [[Festival Tech]] is enabled for the duration of the show, during which players can watch the [[Hopeful Steward]] lead the residents of Aviary Village through the festivities. See the [[Aviary’s Firework Festival#The Finale|Aviary’s Firework Festival]] page for more detailed information.

==<span id="Nest">Aviary Village Nests</span>==
{{Main|Nests}}
[[File:Aviary-Village-Nests-Exterior.png|thumb|300px|Entrance to the Nest]]
The [[Season of Nesting]] further expanded upon Aviary Village by introducing Nests, a personal space that can be customized with [[Props]], which can be found in a newly constructed building to the left of the [[#Season of Revival Cosmetics Shop|Revival Cosmetics Shop]]. This feature is unlocked during the [[Season of Nesting#Quest 2|second Quest]] from the Season of Nesting. 

This cozy, apartment-like space features several windows that peer out into a cloudy landscape, allowing players to enjoy the same [[#Day/Night_Cycle|atmospheric lighting]] seen in Aviary Village. The special [[Shared Spaces|Shared Space Shrine]] that's used to decorate the Nest also features unique privacy settings that allow players to welcome friends inside for a visit or enjoy a quiet break in private mode. A small balcony overlooks the landing plaza, allowing players a fast way back to Aviary Village by flying down from it.<br>

==Traveling Spirits==
Every two weeks, a [[Traveling Spirits|Traveling Spirit]] will appear in Aviary Village and [[Home]] for players who have at least progressed to the [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|third Seasonal Quest]] from [[Season of Revival]]. These Spirits allow the player to collect [[Expression]] upgrades and cosmetics from previous [[Seasons]]. See the [[Traveling Spirits]] page for more detailed information.

==Day/Night Cycle== 
Unlike the lighting at [[Home]], the lighting in Aviary Village changes depending on a set schedule that rotates every hour,<ref name="Cycle change">The schedule for the lighting in Aviary Village initially rotated every four hours before being shortened to a single hour with Patch {{v|0.25.0}}.</ref> starting at reset at 00:00 PST/PDT. This was added in Patch {{v|0.23.5}}, however, players need to have at least started the [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|third Quest]] from the [[Season of Revival]] to experience the lighting changes. The various lightings can also be observed while inside the various shops and buildings within Aviary Village, including the [[#Nest|Nest]].<br>

==Event Announcement Board==

The Event Announcement Board was added with Patch {{v|0.28.0}} and can be found next to the [[#Aviary Event Store|Aviary Event Store]]. When coming near the board, a prompt appears; it will either prompt how many days are left of an event or how many there are until the next one begins. Event Guide Spirits will appear near the board when their event is active, offering players the option to {{Icon|Icon warp.png}} teleport to their event area. Additionally, event-themed decorations and event Spell boxes may be placed around the board. The Sky Event Calender can be accessed through the board as well, by selecting the {{Icon|News-icon.png}} news icon. It displays upcoming social events, such as the [[Additional_Light_Sources#Polluted_Geyser|Sanctuary Geyseir]], and more. It was added in Patch {{v|0.29.5}}.

==Aviary Shops==
Starting with the release of Aviary Village during the [[Season of Revival]], several shops were introduced to the village. Each shop can be unlocked by completing the [[Season of Revival#Spirit Memory Quests|Seasonal Quests]]. The various shops function as [[Cosmetics#Outfit Shrines|Closets]] where players are able to change their outfit and try on cosmetics that are currently available through [[Special Events]], [[Seasons]], etc. There are a total of eight shop buildings in the Live version so far.

<small>Note that when wearing a cosmetic inside a shop that a player does not possess, upon leaving the building the player's cosmetics will revert back to whichever owned items they last tried on.</small> 

===Aviary Event Store===
During [[Aviary’s Firework Festival]] event, a new, permanent event store was opened in Aviary Village. It is located on the left side of the shopping alley, after the Revival Cosmetics Shop. Over time, players will be able to find different kinds of [[Premium Candle Shop|IAP]] and IGC (in-game currency) cosmetics here—some during a set event window, and others as permanent, evergreen items available throughout the year.

Once the preparations for the Firework Festival began, two new cosmetics sets were permanently introduced in the event store to commemorate the occasion. The [[Aviary’s Firework Festival#Moth Appreciation Pack|Moth Appreciation Pack]] and [[Aviary’s Firework Festival#Sparrow Appreciation Pack|Sparrow Appreciation Pack]] are both special starter bundles and a tribute to the community of players who have made Aviary Village and Sky itself vibrant and welcoming to everyone.

An Equipment Rack, sitting to the right of the Appreciation Packs display inside, opened for [[Days of Feast]] 2023 to permanently offer the newly added [[Days of Feast#Course Creation Prop|Course Creation Prop]] for {{Cost|150 C}}.

With the release of Early Access on Steam, players on [[Sky for Steam|Steam PC and Steam Deck]] can find a special item in the Aviary event shop to commemorate their adventures: a [[Sky for Steam#Companion Cube|Companion Cube]], which can be unlocked for {{Cost|50 C}} and will be available permanently in the Event Shop.

The [[Sky for PlayStation#Journey Pack|Journey Pack]] was introduced to the Aviary Event Shop with Patch {{v|0.25.5}}. The [[Sky for PlayStation#Transcendent Journey Pack|Transcendent Journey Pack]] was added for Journey's 13th anniversary.

With Patch {{v|0.27.5}}, the Event Store was moved to where the Revival Cosmetics Shop used to be, and the Event Store area is now used for Event Guides to offer teleportation to Event areas.

Several [[Ancestors#Spirits|Ancestor Spirits]], generally four, wait for you at the archway counter, who will ask for your help with something that they care about. Once a Daily Quest has been completed, interacting with the Ancestor Spirits again will reward players with one [[Currency#Candles|Candle]] per completed Quest. Each of the Ancestor Spirits will leave once their associated Daily Quest is completed. Once all Daily Quests have been completed, the player will be rewarded with a treat if they sit at one of the stools by the counter. Then, the Cafe Manager will clean up, turn off the lights, and leave for the day.

''Tip: You can accept and claim all [[Quests|Daily Quests]] at once by performing a Level 1 or 2 {{Emote|Bow|inline_text}} near the Ancestor Spirits at the Cafe.''

The Sleepy Traveling Merchant can be found just outside of the Aviary's [[#Spell Shop|Spell Shop]], periodically appearing for several weeks whenever there's a new wave of products released on [[thatskyshop]] - an official merchandise website made by thatgamecompany. Unlike in [[Home]], the Sleepy Traveling Merchant in Aviary Village ''does not'' offer any [[Spells]].

Upon selecting the {{Icon|Icon_shop.png}} shopping cart icon above their head, the Merchant will perform the {{Emote|Levitating Adept|inline_text}} Expression to summon a meditation circle on their boat, on which the player may {{Emote|Sit|link=Menus and Controls#Sit|label=Sit|inline_text}} down on to visit the thatskyshop website on the device's external browser.

Unlike other Shrines, this one will automatically play some of the recordings made there if a player is close to it, as a sort of village stage for players to stop by as they’re going through the area. This Shrine will also have weekly prompts, for players looking for ideas for their Shared Memories.

==Map==
{{Map:Aviary Village}}

Unlike any other [[Map Shrines|Map Shrine]] in Sky, players can only activate the [[Map Shrines#Aviary Village|Map Shrine in Aviary Village]] after starting the [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|third Quest]] from the [[Season of Revival]].<br>

==Trivia==
*The Constellation Statue was originally located on the center island in the [[Daylight Prairie#Villages|Villages]] of [[Daylight Prairie]]. Its original purpose was an experimental feature that made it easier for new players to [[Menus and Controls#Expression Menu|request a guide]].
*While the Tranquil Garden is only accessible through Aviary Village, it is technically located in the [[Valley of Triumph]].
