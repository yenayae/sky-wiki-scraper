==Personality==
On April 12, 2023, TGC officially announced and introduced the Passage Guide with the following personality traits:

*🦀 Leaves out food for [[Dark Crabs]] during holidays
*🎭 Favorite skill to teach is mask-making
*🌿 Can show even the brownest thumb how to grow something
*🥸 Wields puns rarely but effectively

==Trivia==
*When speaking to the Passage Guide, the player uses the {{Emote|bow|inline_text}} [[Expression]] to greet them instead of {{Emote|wave|inline_text}}. This is one of only two instances of a unique Expression being used when speaking to a Guide (the other being the [[AURORA Guide]]).
*The Passage Guide can also be found in the Aviary Village's [[Aviary Village#Face Accessories Shop|Face Accessories Shop]] but cannot be interacted with.
