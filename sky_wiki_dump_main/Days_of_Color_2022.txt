Days of Rainbow returned for its third year! The event began on '''Thursday,''' '''June 30, 2022 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended on '''Wednesday, July 13, 2022 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''14''' days. Event Guide Spirits and fellow players celebrated the brilliant mosaic that brings life to the world of Sky.

The Rainbow Guide was present in [[Home]] throughout the event, standing at the water's edge to the left of the Outfit Shrine. A cluster of small floating Jellyfish marked their location. Walking towards the Jellyfish would trigger a cutscene and make the Spirits appear. After hugging each Spirit, players could access their shops.[[File:Days-of-Rainbow-2022-Spirits-Shop-Morybel-0146.png|thumb|500px]]
* The Days of Rainbow Guide ([[Rallying Thrillseeker]] wearing the [[#Rainbow Cape|Rainbow Cape]]) offered all event cosmetics that could be purchased using in-game currency.
* The other Spirit ([[Jelly Whisperer]] wearing the [[#Rainbow Trousers|Rainbow Trousers]]) offered one of the previous [[IAP]] event cosmetics.
* The [[Spell Shop]] at the [[Sleepy Traveling Merchant]]'s boat offered free temporary [[Spells]] for each of the available cosmetics, plus 2 free [[#Rainbow Spell|Rainbow Spells]] and unlimited purchases of [[#Trail Spells|Trail Spells]] ({{Cost|5 C}} each). These same Spells were also available from the Spell Shop at the [[Forgotten Ark]].

Beyond the two Spirits, over the water, was a double rainbow that slowly spawned [[Pieces of Light]]. Each piece of light was a different color and briefly changed your trail into the corresponding color. Large floating Jellyfish around the double rainbow were available to help players recharge.
