== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|C8otHgCYJ7U|thumb|inline|Video Guide}}

The Nightbird Whisperer can be found in the [[Prairie Peaks]], in a bird-filled cave to the left of the entrance of the area, on the left side of the biggest monolith in the middle of the cave. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 11 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Nightbird Whisperer can be seen birdwatching with a notebook in hand, chasing eagerly after their subjects. To better observe a bird landed on the ground, the Spirit hides behind one of the many nearby monoliths. At this point the [[Jolly Geologist]] arrives, walking joyfully through the area, and startles the bird into taking flight by coming too close. The Nightbird Whisperer comes out of hiding to invite the Jolly Geologist to join their birdwatching, guiding them towards an alcove to observe from together.  

At the end of the memory, the Nightbird Whisperer lets out a loud bird's call that echoes through the cave and a bird responds, flying towards the Spirit duo.
