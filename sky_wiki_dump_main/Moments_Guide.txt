==Personality==
On July 11, 2023, TGC officially announced and introduced the Moments Guide with the following personality traits:

*üåÑ Once waited 8 hours to capture sunlight hitting a peak just the right way
*üèïÔ∏è Can pack for a camping trip in 10 min.
*üì∑ Rooms in their house are photogenic from any angle
*üî• Won‚Äôt admit they still need special tools to make a fire

==Trivia==
* The Moments Guide is believed to be inspired by the American landscape photographer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams Ansel Adams] by the community. This is due to the appearance of the Guide and also because during [[Sky Beta|Beta]] testing for the [[Season of Moments]], the prompt for one of the Quests was, "Would you like to help Ansel to take a photo?"
*The Moments Guide can also be found in the Aviary Village's [[Aviary Village#Hair Accessories Shop|Hair Accessories Shop]] but cannot be interacted with.
