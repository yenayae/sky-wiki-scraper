'''Cosmetics''' are wearable items that can be [[collectibles|collected]] by the player in Sky. They are the most common type of collectible. Obtaining cosmetics is not necessary to advance in the game, but it is the primary way to customize the player's appearance.

A complete side-by-side view of the cosmetic icons to their in-game visuals can be found in [[Outfit Shrine]]s.
The cosmetics specifically from Regular Spirits are summarized at [[Regular Spirits/Cosmetics]].''

==Types of Cosmetics==
There are ten different types of cosmetics. At most, one item of each type can be worn at any time. Each of the following pages list all of the items of each type that have ever been made available to players in Sky.

==Outfit Shrines==
Outfit Shrines are where players select which cosmetics to wear and can preview some of the available cosmetics. There are five closets, each providing access to one or two types of cosmetics, as listed above under [[#Types of Cosmetics|Types of Cosmetics]].

When in the closet, a menu is shown listing icons within that cosmetics type.  Three types of icon are possible:
* White icons: items that have been purchased and can currently choose to wear.
* Dim icons: items that can be previewed, but not worn.  If one of these icons are selected, the player will see themselves wearing the item, but only as long as they stay in the closet.  When the player leaves, it will be replaced by the previously-selected purchased item.
** All of the items available from [[Regular Spirits]] and from the current [[Seasonal Events|Season]] are visible as dim icons. When the icon is selected, the player will be told where to find the corresponding spirit.
* Star icons ({{Icon|Four-point-star-Ray.png|link=}}): a handful of other unpurchased items -- in particular [[Elder Hair]] and some [[Special Events|Special Event]] cosmetics -- are represented by placeholder star icons in the closet menu. It is not possible to preview these items or obtain more information about them within the closet. 

Note that many unpurchased items do not appear at all in the closets.  In particular, unowned cosmetics from past [[Seasonal Spirits]] (including any current [[Traveling Spirit]]) do not appear and therefore cannot be previewed.
