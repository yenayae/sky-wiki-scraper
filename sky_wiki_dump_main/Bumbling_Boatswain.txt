==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|UP3-NnTg-ws||inline|Video Guide}}

The Bumbling Boatswain can be found very near the [[Abyss Guide]]'s ship in [[Treasure Reef]] in [[Golden Wasteland]], where a ladder is placed like a bridge between the ship and the land. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
As their memory unfolds, the Bumbling Boatswain, accompanied by the [[Abyss Guide]], can be seen going scavenging for resources that might help them do repairs on the ship. They find some wooden boards near a broken boat and take them back to the ship. Back on the ship, the Bumbling Boatswain promptly walks into a stick from a canopy tent before the Abyss Guide can warn them, making the planks they've collected fall onto their head. They rub their head in pain while the Abyss Guide reaches out to them, concerned.

At the end of the memory, the Bumbling Boatswain rubs their head in pain while the Abyss Guide concernedly reaches towards them.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar rub their lowered head with their right hand, looking up every now and then, while drum and trombone sound effects play at the beginning of the Expression. Every time your avatar looks up, a small squeaking sound plays. Your avatar will continue rubbing their head until you move; when you do, your avatar will let their hand fall and quickly shake their head.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a big, orange exclamation mark flickering above your avatar's head during the beginning of the Expression, and orange circular ripples coming from the right hand as they rub their head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar bend down and hold their chest with both hands, before breathing heavily, holding their chest in pain with their left hand, and supporting themselves on their right knee with their right hand, occasionally looking up and reaching forward with their left hand, while drum and descending trombone sound effects play at the beginning of the Expression. Your avatar will continue these actions until you move; when you do, your avatar will straighten up, their hand still on their chest, and take one last heavy breath.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with orange circular ripples quickly coming from your avatar's back.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
