The Vault of Knowledge, a cool-toned vertical realm with cosmic architecture and variety of puzzles. It is the sixth realm the player visits, set almost entirely indoors with its difficulty significantly lesser than of [[Golden Wasteland]]. The Vault has 8 separated areas<ref>not including [[Hidden Forest#The Wind Paths|The Wind Paths]]</ref>, however the realm has physical 7 floors (excluding the side areas) each representing the previous realms.

Vault of Knowledge contains 5 [[Regular Spirits]] and 18 [[Seasonal Spirits]]. Locations of all available Children of Light, who hold Winged Light, can be found within the [[Children of Light#Vault of Knowledge|Children of Light]] page.

:''Within this article, each floor has been separated for reader clarity and understanding, however in-game Floor 1, 2, 3 and Floor 4, 5, 6 are two large vertical areas separated by loading screens.''

==Social Space==
[[File:Vault SocialSpace1.png|right|300px]]
Similar to [[Isle of Dawn]], Vault also misses the regular features of a Social Space; a bonfire and a closet. However it does still feature a bench to chat with other players as well as Spirit Tombstones presenting the Regular Spirits currently relived in the current realm. To the left of where the player spawns is the entrance to the [[#Collaboration Room|Collaboration Room]], blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring 1 [[Regular Spirit]] from Vault to have been relived. Additionally, the entrance to the [[#Secret Area]] can be found to the left side. To the right is the entrance to the [[#Archives]], blocked by a two-player door as well as a Spirit Gate requiring 1 Regular Spirit from Vault to have been relived again.

In the Social Space, players can find:
* 1 [[Children of Light#Archives|Children of Light]]
* 1 [[Map Shrine#Vault of Knowledge|Map Shrine]]

Vault FloorOne2.png
</gallery>
The First Floor is just past the social space and represents [[Isle of Dawn]], seen by the scattered dunes of sand around the chamber. In the center is an elevator structure surrounded by four lanterns. To the right are four diamonds laying on the ground that prompt the player to use the {{Emote|telekinesis|inline_text}} Expression. If four players use the Expression on the diamonds at once, the wall ahead opens up to lead to a circular area holding two Spirits. To the left is a chat bench with a sapling, as well as the entrance to the [[#Repository of Refuge|Repository of Refuge]], requiring '''one (1)''' Regular Spirit from Vault.

To continue upwards to the next floor, light the four lanterns in the center to summon a meditation circle on the elevator. Sitting on it will ascend the player upwards to Floor 2.

On the First Floor, players can find:
<!--No Map Shrine nor Child of light. Social Space covers it-->

==<span id="Floor Two">Second Floor</span>==
[[File:Vault FloorTwo1.png|right|300px]] [[File:Vault FloorTwo2.png|right|300px]]

The Second Floor represents [[Daylight Prairie]], and where the player first encounters the starry floor. The starry floor allows the player to float, and not fall down to the previous floor, while also recharge the player's light. On this floor, there a chamber blocked by a 4 player gate, requiring four players to simultaneously lift the door open. The chamber holds a single Spirit, various candles scattered around, and a table allowing players to chat with another.

The floor itself contains floating platforms allowing players to reach and light the four lanterns found around the area, which summon floating diamonds to light in order to power up the elevator again and lead the player to the next floor.

On the Second Floor, players can find:
*1 [[Regular Spirit]] ({{Spirit|Levitating Adept|Inline_text}})

== <span id="Floor Three">Third Floor</span>==
[[File:Vault FloorThree1.png|right|300px]]
This floor represents the [[Hidden Forest]], seen with the few trees that can be made on far platforms. It transitions away from the constrictions of the vault walls, opening it to the infinite void. The realm features geyser-like platforms, lifting and recharging the player once lit. Like the previous floors, to continue onto the next floor light the four lanterns on the upper platforms to summon 12 diamonds. Once these 12 are lit, the player can sit on the elevator to ascend to the next floor.

On the Third Floor, players can find:
* 1 [[Children of Light#Third Floor|Children of Light]]
*1 [[Map Shrine#Vault of Knowledge|Map Shrine]]
*1 [[Regular Spirit]] ({{Spirit|Polite Scholar|Inline_text}})

== <span id="Floor Four">Fourth Floor</span> ==
[[File:Vault FloorFour1.png|right|300px]]
The fourth floor represents the [[Valley of Triumph]]. The stone buildings and mini coliseum resemble those found in the races. This floor contains waterfalls of light, stone islands, and a variety of floating platforms. To progress onwards, light the four lanterns on the [[Spirit Mantas]] roaming the floor. This serves as the first encounter of Spirit Mantas by the player.

On the Fourth Floor, players can find:

==<span id="Floor Five">Fifth Floor</span>==
[[File:Vault FloorFive1.png|right|300px]]
The fifth floor represents [[Golden Wasteland]], and has a few skeletons floating in the sky. To reach the next floor, players will need to fly to the [[Mantas#Elder_Spirit_Mantas|Elder Spirit Manta]] which will approach from the {{icon|Constellation-prairie-icon-Ray.png}} Prairie Constellation in the sky. On the back of the Spirit Manta players will find lanterns to light – these activate the elevator at the center.

On the Fifth Floor, players can find:

==<span id="Sixth Floor"><span id="Floor Six">The Summit</span></span>==
[[File:Vault Summit1.png|right|300px]]
The Summit, being the Sixth Floor, is where the [[Elder of the Vault]]'s altar resides. The floor begins with Cosmic Mantas circulating the platform, which players can ride up to reach the Summit, or wait for the elevator to slowly rise up. Differing from all the previous floors, this floor is mostly natural, with a stone island with grass comprising the whole area. Surrounding the Elder's altar is the previous realm's altars: from [[Isle]] to [[Wasteland]]. After lighting the center altar's white candle and meditating to activate a cutscene, the player is transported to the [[#After-Shrine Area|After-Shrine Area]].

At The Summit, players can find: 
*1 [[Children of Light#The Summit|Children of Light]]
*1 [[Map Shrine#Vault of Knowledge|Map Shrine]]
{{Clear}}
==After-Shrine Area==
[[File:Vault AfterShrine1.png|right|300px]]
The final area of Vault, however differing from every other area of the game. This area solely acts as a connection between Vault to the Eye of Eden, with portals leading either [[Home]]/[[Aviary Village]] or into the [[Eye of Eden|Eye of Eden (Spoiler Warning)]]. The Spirit Gate blocking the entry to Eden requires 20 Winged Light to pass through. However, it is recommended to acquire significantly more than this before entering Eden.

In Vault of Knowledge, there is two [[Shared Space Shrines]] in [[#Repository of Refuge|Repository of Refuge]], unlocked after completing [[Season of Remembrance#Quest 1|Remembrance Quest #1]], and the [[#Secret Area|Secret Area]]. A way to play in private or public with friends using props. Shared Space Shrines are accessible to all players who have access to Daylight Prairie but must have at least two props to access edit mode. You can have up to 16 props available at a time on your Shared Space, but can be much less depending on the "load" of the props as determined by how much the top bar fills up. Within the Vault Shared Spaces, there are featured props given to the player to place regardless of if it is owned, being {{Icon|Shared-Spaces-Standing-Lantern-prop-icon-Morybel-0146.png|Inline_text|link=Shared Spaces|label=Shared Spaces Standing Lantern}}, {{Spirit Item|Baffled Botanist|Prop|Inline_text|label=Baffled Botanist Spotlight}}, and {{Spirit Item|Wise Grandparent|Prop|Inline_text|label=Wise Grandparent Lantern}}. Once a prop is in use, it will stay where you left it as long as you don't move it or remove it. The items are sorted by how much "load” they use in a Shared Space, listed from left to right.</div>

* Regular Eruptions
** Starlight Desert, nearby to The Rose
** Starlight Desert, nearby to the pathway to Jellyfish Cove
** Starlight Desert, near the Garden Aviary
* Strong Eruptions
** Starlight Desert, Jellyfish Cove, nearby to the pathway to main area of [[#Starlight Desert|Starlight Desert]]

Collecting the Seasonal Spirits do not count towards realm constellation Spirit Gates. You will be able to collect their base level emotes, but in order to collect the cosmetics or expression upgrades, you will have to wait for the Spirit to return as a [[Traveling Spirit]]. Anything bought from their Friendship Trees do not count towards Realm Constellation Progression.
