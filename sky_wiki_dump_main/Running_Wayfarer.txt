*Level 1 will make your avatar hold their hand up in front of their face, summoning a blue, glowing light ball with a hollow sound effect, before holding their arm up in the air, slowly swaying from side to side. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with golden sparkles following the avatar's hand, and the color of the light ball subtly changing to different colors.
*Level 3 will make your avatar hop up a bit before waving their arm and hips rhythmically from side to side, at a quicker pace than Level 1 and 2, while holding a light ball in their waving hand that appears the same as the one in Level 1. During the Expression, a rhythmic jingle bell sound plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with white starburst effects coming from the waving hand and small golden sparkles following the motion of the other hand.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
