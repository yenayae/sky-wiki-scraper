<!--<div>{{#ev:youtube|YoutubeID|200px|inline|Video Guide}}-->

The [[Scarred Sentry]] can be found in [[The Last City]], before the large Temple gates, guarded by two sentries, at the back of the Marketplace. 

Unlike other Spirits, the Scarred Sentry has no memory that can be relived, but rather a Seasonal Quest dedicated to them. With the Spirit traumatized from recent events and unable to move, players complete a series of tasks, helping the Spirit gain back their bravery and defend against instruders.

Players can interact with the Scarred Sentry without completing any Quests. However, only if no Quest is active can they be interacted with, which can be done by starting a Quest from the [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1]], teleporting Home, and then using the Return Shrine to go back to The Last City. Now no Quest will be active and the player can explore the area freely.

==<span id="Expression">Stance</span>==
This Spirit offers the {{Emote|Scarred Sentry|inline_text}}, which gives the player's avatar a braced look, as if getting ready to fight and defend. The Stance affects the avatar's position when standing, kneeling, sitting, or lying down.

*Standing will make your avatar ball their fists and step back into a fighting stance, right elbow pulled tightly back and left forearm held perpendicular to the ground.
*Kneeling will make your avatar kneel up, and bring their left arm up into a high block.
*Sitting will make your avatar sit with their feet on the floor and knees bent. Their arms will relax slightly.
*Lying Down will make your avatar lie prone with one knee hiked up. Both arms are moved to cover their face as they peek from between their hands.

====Plummed Helmet====
''Not to be confused with the [[#Cracked Helmet|Cracked Helmet]]''.

The second [[Hair]] offered by this Spirit consists of a round helmet and a high ponytail. The helmet is dark gray, with a mute silver rim around the protruding cheek-guards and v-shape between the eyes. The ponytail is tied high at the back and a bit feathered. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node ({{Cost|10 SC|season=Two Embers - Part 1}} total).<br><br>

This Spirit offers a total of two Props: a [[#Sentry Shield|Sentry Shield]] and a [[#Sentry Spear Prop|Sentry Spear]].
====Sentry Shield====
The first [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a worn, dark green shield with silver edges. The center is decorated with a silver emblem: a four-pointed star with a wide top arm, surrounded by four diamonds. When equipped, the shield is held with one arm at the side—upon selecting its {{Spirit Item|Scarred Sentry|prop_c|icon}} icon at the bottom of the screen, the avatar jumps and holds up the shield in front of them. It cannot be placed and therefore cannot be used in [[Shared Spaces]]. When carried on its owner's back, the Prop appears in its original form. It was available to all players during the Season from the Friendship Tree's fifth node ({{Cost|76 SC|season=Two Embers - Part 1}} total).<br><br>

====Sentry Spear====
The second [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a wide-bladed spear with a glowing diamond in the center. The shaft has two cord-wrapped grips. When equipped, the spear is held with one arm at the side—upon selecting its {{Spirit Item|Scarred Sentry|prop_s|icon}} icon at the bottom of the screen, the avatar performs a spin trick with it. It cannot be placed and therefore cannot be used in [[Shared Spaces]]. When carried on its owner's back, the Prop appears in its original form. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's sixth node ({{Cost|110 SC|season=Two Embers - Part 1}} total).<br><br>
