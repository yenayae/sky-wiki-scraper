== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|PLP7r3UoIwo||inline|Video Guide}}

The Nodding Muralist can be found on the left end of the [[Forgotten Ark]] in [[Golden Wasteland]] when facing its front. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 5 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Nodding Muralist can be seen painting murals on different sections of the Forgotten Ark, even using a ladder in certain areas.

At the end of the memory, the [[Snoozing Carpenter]] approaches the Nodding Muralist who stands in front of a freshly completed mural. They start applauding the Muralist, which comes to step besides them. Satisfied with their work, the Muralist nods in agreement.<br>

* Level 1 will make your avatar simply nod their head once, while a guitar strum sound effect plays.
* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a cyan glowing ring and a small burst of white sparkles appearing around your avatar's head.
* Level 3 will make your avatar hop forwards and put their hands on their hips as they land, before nodding several times while gradually moving their head from one side to another, finishing off by leaning forward a bit and putting emphasis on their last nod, while guitar strum sound effects play with the rhythm of every nod.
* Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a glowing white ring and a small burst of white sparkles appearing around your avatar's head as they nod, finished off with a burst of glowing big blue sparkles flying from the motion of the last nod.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
