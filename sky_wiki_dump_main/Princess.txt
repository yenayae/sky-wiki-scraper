== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|AUaxZNv_Cec|200px|inline|Video Guide}}

The Princess can be found in the [[Crescent Oasis]], in the round chamber hidden behind the throne room in the Royal Palace. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Princess can be seen lounging on a mat at the center of the chamber while [[Mantas]] and [[Birds]] fly overhead. As the Spirit falls asleep, they begin to dream of the Nine-Colored Deer and of chasing after the spectral creature as it prances gracefully through the air. When the Princess eventually wakes, it's to the sight of the [[Feudal Lord]] approaching their resting place.

At the end of the memory, the Princess rises from their mat and rushes to greet the Feudal Lord, eager to share the contents of their dream - and of a desire to make it become a reality.

*Level 1 will make your avatar float off the ground and slowly spin in place, striking an elegant pose with one arm raised and the other behind their back, while a gentle harp sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with sparkles trailing from your avatar's hands and a golden halo around their head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar float off the ground and spin in place, striking an elegant pose, before tilting backwards to complete a circular swoop back upright, while a more elaborate harp sound effect plays.
