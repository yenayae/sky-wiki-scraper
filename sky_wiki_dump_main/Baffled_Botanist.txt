The Baffled Botanist is found in the [[Hidden Forest]], in the third area of the [[Forest Clearing]], behind the first treehouse on the player's left-handed side upon entering. The collectibles [[#Traveling Spirit|offered]] by this Spirit are a {{Spirit Item|Baffled Botanist|Mask|inline_text}}, a {{Spirit Item|Baffled Botanist|Hair|inline_text}}, and a {{Spirit Item|Baffled Botanist|Prop|label=Spotlight Prop|inline_text}}.<section end="Summary" />

== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|ESYM7mzrZv8||inline|Video Guide}}

The Baffled Botanist can be found in the [[Hidden Forest]], in the third area of the [[Forest Clearing]], behind the first treehouse on the player's left-handed side upon entering. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
The second and fifth memory fragments are exposed to the [[Seasonal Spirits#Spirit Health|polluted rain]], so players should hurry with reliving them. 

As their memory unfolds, the Baffled Botanist can be seen carrying a heavy lantern from the bottom of the treehouse, up the stairs, and onto a bookshelf located on the top platform. Once done, they go down again,  pick up another lantern, and bring it up the stairs. Unfortunately, they drop the lantern off the top platform. 

At the end of the memory, the Baffled Botanist looks from the treehouse down to the [[Scolding Student]], which stands next to the broken lantern, which makes the Botanist slam their palm against their forehead and shake their head in dismay.<br>

* Level 1 will make your avatar look up slightly before slamming their right hand on their forehead and shaking their head while letting it gradually fall, the hand still on their forehead, while a single cymbal sound effect plays.
* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a blue trail of light following the motion of your avatar's hand as they slam it against their head, as well as a red symbol portraying a popped vein appearing near the head.
* Level 3 will make your avatar slam both their hands to their forehead while letting their head fall behind, before letting their hands slide downwards over their face and quickly snapping their head back up, while a series of cymbal sound effects play.
* Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with white sparkles bursting from the impact of your avatar's hands on their face.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
