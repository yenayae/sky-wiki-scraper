{{Getting Started Nav|2}}

==Movement/Controls==
Your movement consists of '''walking/running/skating''', '''swimming''', '''jumping''', and '''flying'''. You can also '''emote''', '''interact''' with your environment, and '''honk/deep call'''.
{{Tip|"Honking" refers to your player character's short call, also known as "chirp". To honk, tap on yourself.<br>To make a "big call", "deep call", "yell", or "long call", hold instead of tapping.}}
In the tutorial, you unlock flying shortly into the Isle of Dawn, the first realm.
* For flight, see [[Menus_and_Controls#Flight_and_Movement_Controls:_iOS_and_Android]] and [[Advanced Flying]].
* For swimming/diving, see [[Season_of_Abyss#Dive_Mechanic]].

===What can I interact with?===
Most interactions are shown via a dark grey circle above the item/spirit/etc you can interact with. The icon in the circle shows you what type of interaction it is. A non-exhaustive list:
* {{Icon|Icon_flame.png}} — bring out your candle and slowly walk towards the item to light,
** {{Icon|Light-someone-Ray.png}} — the same, but when lighting a player.
* {{Icon|Grab-Ray.png}} — collect the wax from/pick up items,
* {{Icon|ButterflyCharmer-1.png}}(any emote) — perform that emote to affect something in your environment (you must have learned the expression first),
* {{Icon|Icon high five.png}}(any 2-player emote) — perform that emote with the Spirit or player,
* {{Icon|Merch-Ray.png}} — access the spirit's friendship tree.
If you're in a spot with multiple possible interactions, you might need to shimmy around a little to have the right item's interaction pop up.

Aside from that, you can 
* deep call to get a boost from nearby butterflies.

==In-App Purchases (IAP)==
A small subset of in-game items are only available for real-life currencies. These are referred to as "IAPs".

You can access the main [[Premium Candle Shop]] from anywhere, but some items might only be found in {{Icon|Gift-box-icon.png}} special shops in the event area. The purchase is made through the app store/digital marketplace of your specific platform — for example, on iOS you buy through the App Store, Switch through the eShop.

* The only sources of in-game items are through the app or thatskyshop.com. Be careful about scams!
* There is no in-game way of disabling purchases; you will have to check your platform's digital marketplace settings.
* Receipts are similarly only available through the platform marketplace you purchased them on.

==Managing Your Account==
Most account-related utility can be found in the Account menu, found at: {{Icon|Settings-gear-Ray.png}}Settings->{{Icon|Checkmark-Ray.png}}Account.<br>
Your "Sky ID" is a unique identifier for your account, as Sky doesn't have usernames. It can be found in Account->Account Information.
<br>
{{Tip|To help with recovering your account, or other support ticket items, save your Sky ID somewhere secure! Do NOT share your ID, except with Customer Support!}}

===Saving Your Progress/Linking Your Account===
Your progress is saved locally to your device. However, to play on the same account across platforms, or if you uninstall the game, you must '''link your account'''.<br>
You link your Sky game progress to an account on an external platform. As of 07 December 2024, the types of accounts you can link to are: Game Center, Gmail, Facebook, Apple, Nintendo, HUAWEI, Playstation, Steam, and Twitch. The easiest might be Gmail, if you have it.
* One Sky account can be linked to multiple external accounts, as long as they're different types.
* One external account cannot be linked to multiple Sky accounts; you must first unlink it from the old Sky account ([https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/1292-i-accidentally-created-a-new-sky-account-on-steam-before-linking-my-existing-sky-account-how-do-i-unlink-the-new-sky-account-and-link-my-existing-account/ how to unlink]).
* On a new device, log into your external account '''first''', or else a fresh savefile and account will be made locally.

To link an account, go to {{Icon|Checkmark-Ray.png}}Account, then select your desired external account type, and log in.

Then, on the login screen (with the message of the day and the Play button), select "Sign In Method" at the bottom and sign into that same account.

'''Important Notes:'''
* After making a purchase on a game account, you may be unable to unlink its external accounts.
* Customer Support cannot help you manually unlink accounts.
* When playing on Switch/PC/Playstation, your account is automatically linked to the Nintendo/Steam/Playstation account logged into.
* You may need to download Sky on mobile for the ability to link to the other types of external account.
* By linking to a Game Service (ex: Game Center), Support may be unable to recover your account should you lose it.

===Contacting Support===
The fastest way to contact TGC Support for account-related things is through the game. Go to Settings->Support; the FAQ/Support page will then open. In the top-right, click on the speech bubble and select your issue category to begin the chat.<br>
Other ways include using the "Contact Us" form at the bottom of the [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/ web version of the FAQ] or through email.

===Recovering An Account===
To recover an account, you must contact Support. They will then request the following information:
* your new Sky ID,
* the Sky ID for the account you wish to recover,
* the nicknames of 5 friends on your account.

If you do not have your ID, please contact someone who you’re friends with in Sky who can submit a ticket on your behalf including the nickname they’ve given you on their account as well as your ticket number. This will be used to locate your account in our system.<ref>https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/931-what-does-tgc-need-to-recover-my-lost-sky-account/</ref>

'''Note that if the account was linked with a Game Service, they cannot recover it.'''

===Deleting An Account===
Deleting an account is '''permanent''', and the account can no longer be restored. It will remove all your personal and game data from Sky and its servers. To do this, go to Account->Account Info->Delete Account.
