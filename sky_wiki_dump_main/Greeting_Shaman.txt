== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|do0FvgzMOPI|200px|inline|Video Guide by Tara}} 

The Greeting Shaman can be found on the [[Vault of Knowledge#Fourth Floor|Fourth Floor]] of the Vault of Knowledge , at the top of a set of nine moving platforms in front of the Hidden Forest Constellation. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 5 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

This Spirit memory can be challenging to complete, as it involves navigating between moving platforms to collect each memory fragment. It is technically possible to complete this memory without flying (as shown in the video), although it will be of much help if the player has enough Cape Energy.

It is possible to travel across the whole structure by jumping between platforms and by waiting for each pair of platforms to come together and jump at the point of closest approach. If the player has enough Cape Energy and means to recharge (such as a friend or an [[Spells#Instant Recharge Potion|Instant Recharge Spell]]), this memory can also be completed by flying.

As their memory unfolds, the Greeting Shaman can be seen dancing on moving platforms of varying altitudes, striking different poses along the way. 

At the end of the memory, the Greeting Shaman acknowledges the player by punching one fist into the flat palm of their other hand and motioning it forwards.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar raise their arms in a 90° angle and punch a closed fist into their opened left palm, before sharply pushing their arms forward with both hands still held together while a thud and a bell sound effect play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with small golden sparkles appearing from your avatar's hands while they are touching.
*Level 3 will make your avatar rapidly stretch both arms forward, joining at the hands, pull them closer to their chest while they stay parallel to the ground, and move both arms outwards before performing the same motion as in Level 1, while punching and bell sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with a small burst of golden sparkles coming from your avatar's hands at the moment of impact.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

=== Instrument ===
The [[Instrument]] offered by this Spirit is the ''' Large Bell''', costing {{Cost|45 C}} from the Traveling Spirit. It is made of a metallic body and handle, with orange details and golden accents. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node ({{Cost|18 SC|season=Gratitude}} total). The player is standing up while playing and clanging on the bell with large arms movement just like the [[Small Bell]]. Both bells have similar sounds, but the large bell is somewhat louder with more of an echo and extended ring.
<!-- This bit of wiki magic transcludes (duplicates) the text used for the small bell, on the Leaping Dancer page. -->

In [[Harmony Hall]], the Large Bell can be found in the left-hand room, in a corner with the other percussion Instruments.<br>
