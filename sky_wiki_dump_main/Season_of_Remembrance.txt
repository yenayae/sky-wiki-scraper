==Welcome==
<center class="title-text-welcome">[https://www.thatskygame.com/news/links-to-the-past-in-season-of-remembrance Welcome to the Season of Remembrance!]</center>{{Quote|<br>'''''Beneath the Vault of Knowledge, the door to a lost Repository has opened.'''''}}
This season is about diving deeper into Sky's lore. Season of Remembrance returns to more intimate storytelling within the Vault of Knowledge, where four new Spirits have found shelter from the upheaval disrupting their lives in the kingdom they had known.

<small>Note that Season of Remembrance can be enjoyed by all players who have progressed through at least Vault of Knowledge.</small>

== Repository of Refuge==
{{Quote|<br>'''''Where the past meets the present.'''''|Repository of Refuge Opening}}
The [[Repository of Refuge]] is a new area that has been added to the Vault of Knowledge, accessible from the first floor, through an underground passage next to the Sapling. One spirit from the Vault of Knowledge is needed to enter. As you descend the steps, you enter an old repository that once served as an archive. The broken tower is surrounded by many floating platforms in an endless night where a lone manta invites players to take a ride in the starry night.<br>

Grab their hand by clicking the series of emotes offered by them. (''Take notice of the item they each possess as you will need them later'').
