The Herb Gatherer can be found within the village in the [[Crescent Oasis]], in front of the bridge that spans across the river outside of the Royal Palace. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Herb Gatherer can be seen kneeling on a blanket that displays various herbs, selling their wares to the residents of the village. A passing Spirit stops to make a purchase but is soon called away by their companions. The distracted shopper drops one of their purchased herbs as they hurry away, prompting the Herb Gatherer to chase after them to return it, grabbing their attention with a whistle. With all their herbs accounted for, the shopper continues heading towards a gathering crowd, followed by a curious Herb Gatherer. 

At the end of the memory, the Herb Gatherer observes what has drawn a crowd - the [[Feudal Lord]] has posted a notice calling for the capture of the Nine-Colored Deer for all to see.

*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with a larger pulsing yellow halo appears in front of your avatar during the whistle and white dots expressing your cone of vision following the head movements.

==Personality==
On January 12, 2024, TGC officially announced and introduced the Herb Gatherer with the following personality traits:

* üåø Tends to take other people‚Äôs suggestions
* üåø Won‚Äôt share where they find the best herbs, not even with their friends
* üåø Is a little bored with the daily routine, if they‚Äôre being honest
* üåø Gets resentful when they feel overlooked

==Trivia==
*Levels 1 and 2 of the Herb Gatherer's {{Emote|Herb Gatherer|inline_text}} is one of only two [[Expressions]] (the other being {{Emote|Crab Walker|inline_text}}) to feature sound effect variations when used, with four unique whistle sounds possible.

* The Herb Gatherer is referred to as "he" in Seasonal Quests. During the third Quest in the [[Season of the Nine-Colored Deer]], the narration reads, "but the villager knew that he could be rewarded."
**The Herb Gatherer is one of the few characters to be referred to with gendered pronouns. ''This is not indicative of a Spirit's canonical gender.'' See [[Ancestors#Gender|here for more information]].
