The '''Nesting Workshop''' is a Seasonal Area added to [[Aviary Village]], introduced along with the [[Season of Nesting]] in Patch {{v|0.25.0}}. It is the second shop on the right side of the shop alley and is run by the [[Nesting Guide]], marked by a sign outside with the Season's emblem. Inside, players are able to purchase the [[Season of Nesting#All Nesting Friendship Trees|Season of Nesting's cosmetics]] from special display stands. Players can also purchase a rotating selection of permanent furniture from the main counter of the Nesting Workshop. Lastly, players can access [[#Nesting Challenges|Nesting Challenges]] here once they start the [[Season of Nesting#Quest #3|third Seasonal Quest]] from Season of Nesting.<br>

==Nesting Challenges==
[[File:Nesting-Challenge-Board.png|thumb|right|300px|Nesting Challenge Board]]
Nesting Challenges are a permanent addition to ''Sky'' and can be accessed once you start the [[Season of Nesting#Quest# 3|third Seasonal Quest]] from [[Season of Nesting]]. There are three categories of challenges displayed on a board in the Nesting Workshop, each with their own Friendship Tree and rewards. Once all challenges in a Tree are completed, a unique interactive item becomes available to unlock for in-game currency.

Some challenges are focused on the player's [[Season of Nesting#Nest|Nest]], while others can be done out in the [[Realms]]. These are entirely separate from the Season, so they can be completed over time as you play the game in your style and on your own schedule!<br>

==<span id="Prop">Nesting Workshop Props</span>==
A rotating selection of over 50 stone [[Props]] are '''permanently available''' in the Nesting Workshop for in-game currency, with a set of four different items offered each week. These items rotate every Monday at 00:00 PST/PDT. The [[Season of Nesting#Quest #1|first Seasonal Quest]] from [[Season of Nesting]] must be completed in order to unlock this shop. Once unlocked, these Props can be purchased by clicking the {{Icon|Meditating-Monastic-3.png}} chair icon found on the front counter at the center of the room. 

A display of the Props currently on sale can be found directly across from the front counter, along the wall where the entrance to the Nesting Workshop is located. Any of the currently available items that feature a unique interaction, such as sitting or drinking, can be tested on the displayed Props.

The table below lists all the Props available from the Nesting Workshop and the order they appear, alongside their price and the number of individual copies<ref name="prop_copies">When the Nesting Workshop was first introduced, Props could only be purchased in sets, meaning players would by default buy multiple copies of a single Prop to use in [[Shared Spaces]]. Starting in Patch {{v|0.27.0|0.27.0}}, the Nesting Workshop now sells Props as individual items at lower prices, allowing players to decide if they would like to spend more to buy additional copies.</ref> that can be purchased for each Prop. Once a Prop has been purchased from the Nesting Workshop, it's also possible to buy additional copies of it while editing a [[Shared Space]]. When you’ve placed all the copies you currently have of that Prop, a “+” symbol will appear on its icon if additional copies can be purchased. 

===Permanent Items===
The '''Permanent Items''' a new section for permanent offerings in addition to a rotating items section. It was introduced in Patch {{v|0.27.5}} and makes it possible to unlock certain Nest essentials without having to wait for their rotation to come around. It includes 7 [[Props]] and a [[Shared Spaces#Shared Space Spells|Shared Space Spell]].

Week 1 started on the first day of the [[Season of Nesting]] on Monday, April 15, 2024.
