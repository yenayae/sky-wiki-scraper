==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|JJGW3koPH3Y||inline|Video Guide}}

The Overactive Overachiever can be found in the [[Isle of Dawn]], between the entrance of a semi-hidden cave on the left side of the area, and a pillar near another cave. (''Note: Meditate next to the Passage Stone campfire and turn Isle of Dawn to nightfall in order to see this Spirit.'')  This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, two young Spirits can be seen racing each other up a hill, with the Overactive Overachiever watching from a distance. At the end of the race, the victor jumps in the air in celebration of their win. The Overactive Overachiever then steps closer to wave and invite the pair to another race.  All three Spirits return to the bottom of the hill to begin the race, with the Overactive Overachiever quickly passing them and taking the lead. At the top of the hill, the two defeated young Spirits rest, winded after their tiring race, while the Overactive Overachiever climbs a bar that is protruding from a tall rock nearby.

At the end of the memory, the Overactive Overachiever shows off their boundless energy by performing one-handed pull-ups. The other young Spirits watch on in disbelief, glancing at each other with a defeated expression.

*Level 1 will make your avatar look to the left, rub their hands together, and shake them out again, before a white, horizontal bar of light appears above them. A realistic hand-rubbing sound effect plays as they rub their hands, a quick row of xylophone notes plays as they shake put their hands, and a high-pitched sound effect plays as the bar of light spawns. Your avatar will then hop up to grab the bar with both hands and start doing pull-ups while a few quick xylophone notes play with each pull. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon doing so, your avatar will start to struggle and wiggle their legs before hanging down the bar and letting themselves fall on their feet.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with glowing, blue sparkles raining down from your avatar's head with each pull.
*Level 3 will make your avatar jump up at a horizontal, white bar of light and make a full rotation around it, before letting themselves hang down, place one of their hands on their other arm, and perform pull-ups with one hand. A high-pitched sound effect plays as the bar of light spawns, a row of quick xylophone notes plays as your avatar performs the full rotation and with each pull-up. Additionally, small, blue sparks fizzle around each end of the bar of light, and a trail of small, golden sparkles flies up on each side next to your avatar with each pull-up. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character. Upon doing so, your avatar will perform a full reverse rotation and finish with a gymnastic dismount by stretching their arms up at an angle as if they were making a "Y" with their body.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with white trails of light following the movement of your avatar's feet, only on the forward and backward rotations at the beginning and end of the Expression, respectively.

<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
