Sky’s First Edition Art Book was released on February 9 2024, during That Sky Shop's [[That Sky Shop/Wave 11|Wave 11]]. Thoughtfully presented as a special deluxe collector’s set, The Art of Sky contains over 260 pages of never-before-seen concept art, behind-the-scenes commentary, and fresh insights about the game’s characters, history, and lore. In this artfully curated visual adventure through seven years of game development, the artists and designers of Sky: Children of the Light will take fans beyond the game and into the creation of its enchanting imagery. The book also features the brand new STAR feature, unlocking exclusives to enhance your in-game experience. After three meticulous years in the making, this hardback book has been printed in stunning quality, and each copy is individually numbered. As a pre-order bonus, a collectible set of 8 postcards and 3 posters will be included, making it a truly unique collector’s item worth cherishing.
