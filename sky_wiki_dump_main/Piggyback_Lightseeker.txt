== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|aWLxwkk87kc||inline|Video Guide}}

The Piggyback Lightseeker can be found in a semi-hidden cave on the left side of [[Isle of Dawn]]. In the side of a large dune facing the shore, a tunnel with a Constellation Gate can be found, requiring players to have relived the memory of three [[Hidden Forest]] Spirits to enter. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 6-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

In order to collect the last two fragments, players have to pass a flooded area, which can be overcome by slowly swimming alongside a wall, carrying the light alongside it.

As their memory unfolds, the Piggyback Lightseeker can be seen making their way through the cave, guiding the [[Rejecting Voyager]] and another Spirit to bring each an orb to an offering vessel.

At the end of the memory, the Piggyback Lightseeker motions the player to jump on their back.<br>
