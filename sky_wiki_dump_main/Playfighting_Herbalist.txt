==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|2C7nqLsQKDU||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Playfighting Herbalist can be found past the [[Forgotten Ark]], in a set of ruins overgrown with [[Darkness|Darkness Plants]] on the left side of the map. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Playfighting Herbalist and their friend, the [[Scarecrow Farmer]], can be seen collecting mushrooms growing among the ruins of a boat.

At the end of the memory, the Scarecrow Farmer sneaks up on the Playfighting Herbalist and scares them as a prank. The frightened Spirit drops their gathered mushrooms into the [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Polluted_Water|Polluted Water]] below, rendering them inedible. The Playfighting Herbalist slowly turns around and playfully ‘attacks’ the Farmer in retaliation, as the Scarecrow Farmer crouches down, arms thrown up, in an attempt to shield themselves from their friend’s ‘attack.'<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar crouch down with their hands held at the ready before standing back up to playfully hit your friend on their back, as they turn away from your avatar's hands to accept the blows, while a crashing percussion sound effect plays.
*Level 2 will make your avatar crouch down with their hands held at the ready before standing back up to playfully hit your friend at a more rapid pace, as they turn to the side and hold up an arm in attempt to fend off the blows, while a more dramatic percussion sound effect plays.

Like any [[Friendship Menu#Extended Two-Player Abilities|Extended Two-Player Abilities]], this ability can be upgraded by opening your friend's Friendship Menu. Unlocking the Level 1 ability will cost you {{Cost|8 C}}. After unlocking Level 1, it will cost you {{Cost|10 C}} more to upgrade to the Level 2. (See [[Friendship Menu]] to view the entire Friendship Tree.)

As a Traveling Spirit, the price of the Friend Action upgrade was {{Cost|10 H}}. During the Season, Level 1 was free, but Level 2 was only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
