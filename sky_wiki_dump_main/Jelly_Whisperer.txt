== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|svKLM5uXQpg||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Jelly Whisperer can be found in the [[Sanctuary Islands]], within a cavern filled with floating [[Jellyfish]] on the back side of the main island. This Spirit has a [[Collection Memory|collection memory]] with 10 memory fragments and a 16-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Jelly Whisperer and the [[Sanctuary Guide]] can be seen roaming around the cavern together, playfully interacting with the many floating [[Jellyfish]] that inhabit the area, and performing several flips and jumps by bouncing on their tops.

At the end of the memory, the two Spirits stare at a particularly large Jellyfish with awe. The Jelly Whisperer lets out several gentle sounding Calls that echo through the cavern, to which the Jellyfish responds with its own Call.<br>

=== Prop ===
The [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a striped beach umbrella, costing {{Cost|15 H}} from the Traveling Spirit. It is a placeable Prop that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]] and protects players who stand under it from [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Rain|polluted rain]]. Note that it cannot be held in hand while walking (unlike the umbrellas from the {{Spirit|Laidback Pioneer|inline_text}}, the [[Days of Summer]] event, or the [[Season of Lightseekers]] Ultimate Prop). It appears as an open umbrella on its owner's back when carried.

This item was not available during the [[Season of Sanctuary]]. Instead, it was added to the Jelly Whisperer's Friendship Tree during their first visit as a [[Traveling Spirit]] on November 25, 2021.<br>
