'''Hidden Forest''', often shortened to '''Forest''', is a concealed woodland with meditative rainfall. It is the third [[Realm]] the player enters, introducing the main gimmick for Forest: rainfall. Rainfall begins after player passes the first gate in the [[#Forest Clearing|Forest Clearing]]. It passively drains the player's light whenever they are unsheltered, which can be recharged by standing near a light source or by interacting with a friend. Hidden Forest is separated into seven areas. While the game does not explicitly mention the names of all the areas, it can be derived from landmarks and developer mentions. For reading simplicity, this page will be sectioning the areas further in depth. Throughout the Realm are the Assembly treehouses, smaller branches of the main Treehouse which hold Quests for the [[Season of Assembly]].<br>
<br>
Hidden Forest holds 8 [[Regular Spirits]] and 14 [[Seasonal Spirits]]. Locations of all available Children of Light, who hold Winged Light, can be found of the [[Children of Light#Hidden Forest|Children of Light]] page.

==Social Space==
[[File:Forest SocialSpace1.png|right|300px]]
This is the area that you glide into after the transition from [[Daylight Prairie]], as well as where you spawn if you go through the Forest Portal.

There is a bonfire in the center, surrounded by two benches. To the left is the [[Closet Shrine]] and a Meditative Stone, where you can get a [[Heart]] after a prompt to rate and review Sky on the App Store. The rating and review prompt will not display if you have disabled “App Rating and Review” in App Store settings, or you have triggered this prompt for more than three times over the past 365 days. In this case, the Meditative Stone seems to be “stuck” indefinitely, and you will not get the Heart reward.
Scattered around the space are Spirit Tombstones, displaying Forest's [[Regular Spirits]]. From the Social Space, you take off into a concealed forest and glide through the clouds to the [[#Forest Clearing|Forest Clearing]]. The [[#Wind Paths|Wind Paths]] can also be accessed by taking off and flying to the immediate right, where an opening in the clouds can be found.

In the Social Space, players can find a single [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]].

[[File:Forest ForestClearing1.png|right|300px]] [[File:Forest ForestClearing2.png|right|300px]] [[File:Forest ForestClearing3.png|right|thumb|300px|First Assembly treehouse]]
Forest Clearing is a large plain with intact structures scattered throughout it. Before the gate to the left is a Sapling and a bench. Passing the gate triggers a cutscene where it begins raining in the whole Realm. Rain passively drains the player's light whenever they are unsheltered, which can be recharged by standing near a light source or interacting with a friend. In the first enclosed area, to the right under the arch is a secret place with white candles, which upon lighting summons [[Murals]]. Within the second area to the left is an Assembly treehouse holding the [[Season_of_Assembly#Quest_#1|Assembly Quest #1]] and [[Season_of_Assembly#Quest_#4|Assembly Quest #4]].

In the Forest Clearing, players can find:
* 2 [[Children_of_Light#Forest Clearing|Children of Light]]
* 1 [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]]
* 1 [[Regular Spirits|Regular Spirit]] ({{Spirit|Shivering Trailblazer|inline_text}})

==<span id="Forest Brook">Forest's Brook</span>==
[[File:Forest ForestsBrook1.png|right|300px]] [[File:Forest ForestsBrook2.png|right|thumb|300px|Second Assembly Treehouse]]
A transition takes you to an open area that is bisected by a river. Trees, treehouses, [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Darkness|Darkness]], [[Dark Crabs]], and [[Light Bloom|Light Blooms]] are discovered here. Dark Crabs can charge towards you and drain your light, while Light Blooms can hold the player and recharge your light. To the immediate right upon transition is a passage to [[#Elevated Clearing|Elevated Clearing]], where there is a cave opening blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring all 8 [[Regular Spirits]] from Hidden Forest to have been relived. To the upper left there is Assembly's second treehouse, holding [[Season_of_Assembly#Quest_#2|Assembly Quest #2]] and [[Season_of_Assembly#Quest_#5|Assembly Quest #5]]. Additionally, a Passage Mask is found left of the brook by a tree with Light Blooms, near the transition from the [[#Forest's Clearing|Forest Clearing]]. It offers the chance to begin [[Season_of_Passage#Quest_#2|Passage Quest #2]].

In the Forest's Brook, players can find:
* 4 [[Children_of_Light#Forest Brook|Children of Light]]
* 1 [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]]

==<span id="Sunny Forest">Elevated Clearing</span>==
[[File:Forest ElevatedClearing1.png|right|300px]] <!-- [[File:Forest ElevatedClearing3.png|right|300px|Grandma]] --> 
Elevated Clearing, often called ''Sunny Forest'' by the community, is an area connecting two areas - [[#Forest's Brook|Forest's Brook]] and [[#Boneyard|Boneyard]] - offering an alternative pathway through Hidden Forest. It can be accessed at either end, requiring bypassing a Spirit Gate needing 8 Forest Regular Spirits relived.

Towering trees populate the area, with two hollow trees standing out. One houses a table that seats eight players and was part of the [[Season of Belonging]] story. It now holds the [[Additional_Light_Sources#Grandma's_Dinner_Event|Grandma's Dinner Social Light Event]]. The other, seen from the bridge as a hollow tree, has a two-person trap door that leads to the [[#Underground Cavern|Underground Cavern]].

In the Elevated Clearing, players can find:
* 2 [[Children_of_Light#Elevated Clearing|Children of Light]]
* 1 [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]]

==Underground Caverns==

[[File:Forest ElevatedClearing2.png|right|thumb|300px|Entrance to Underground Cavern]] [[File:Forest UndergroundCavern1.png|right|300px]]
{{#lst:Underground Caverns|Summary}} {{Wind Pathway|1}}, immediately under the platform with a [[Children_of_Light#Underground_Cavern_(4)|Child of Light (#14)]] - next to a non-functional gated structure.

As players fall from the Elevated Clearing entrance, they will see Light Blooms and waxed pots of [[Butterflies]] blocked by Darkness. To further proceed into the cavern ahead, players will have to burn the pots and release a [[Deep Call]] to fly up with the Butterflies, climb the scattered Light Blooms, or enter the caverns via the [[#The Wind Paths|Wind Paths]].

In the Underground Caverns, players can find:  
*4 [[Children_of_Light#Underground Caverns|Children of Light]]
*1 [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]]

[[File:Forest Boneyard1.png|right|300px]] [[File:Forest Boneyard2.png|right|300px]] <!--[[File:Forest Boneyard3.png|right|thumb|300px|Third Assembly Treehouse]]-->

The first part of this area consists mainly of hollow tree tunnels and the final treehouse from [[Season of Assembly]]. Scattered around are Light Blooms, along with Darkness. To the left is an expansive lake surrounded by trees. Straight ahead leads to the second half of the area. To the right is Assembly's third treehouse, holding the [[Season_of_Assembly#Quest_#3|Assembly Quest #3]] and the [[Season_of_Assembly#Quest_#6|Assembly Quest #6]]. There is also a Passage Mask near the transition from [[#Forest's Brook|Forest's Brook]], to the immediate left with the lamp, offering [[Season_of_Passage#Quest_#5|Passage Quest #5]].

The second half is a flooded land with broken bridges, [[Whales|Whale]] bones, and ruined trees. To the right is a passage to [[#Elevated Clearing|Elevated Clearing]] blocked by a Spirit Gate requiring all 8 Forest Regular Spirits relived. From here the player has to reach the [[#Forest Temple|Forest Temple]] overlooking the entire area from above. To reach it, light all 3 bridge towers in order, or fly to the final tower and light all the white candles. Subsequently, swarms of [[Jellyfish]] will appear as the rain stops in the area, allowing the player to proceed towards the Temple - by flying to it directly or jumping from Jellyfish to Jellyfish. Alternatively, follow the flock of [[Birds]] flying to the Temple.

In the Boneyard, players can find: 
*3 [[Children_of_Light#Boneyard|Children of Light]]
*1 [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]]
*4 [[Regular Spirits]] ({{Spirit|Dismayed Hunter|inline_text}},{{Spirit|Apologetic Lumberjack|inline_text}}, {{Spirit|Whale Whisperer|inline_text}}, {{Spirit|Tearful Light Miner|inline_text}})

== <span id="Temple">Forest Temple</span>==
[[File:Forest Temple1.png|right|300px]]
After ascending the Jellyfish to the top, the player reaches the Forest Temple. The Forest Temple is a large cathedral overlooking the entirety of the [[#Boneyard|Boneyard area]]. Entry is blocked by two buttons on the side of the door, which upon lighting open the door.

The interior is factory-like, with elevators and buttons to be lit. There are a few patches of Darkness Plants here, but no Spirits. To the right of the central shrine is a grand Darkness Plant that rises several steps above the works. This plant has a couple of major branches to climb. While you're burning down one branch, the other will regrow, so it will take two players working together to completely burn it out. Once an entire branch is burned, one player may guard the bottom of the plant while another finishes the other side. There are also [[Dark Crabs|Crabs]] near the plant, so [[Deep Call|Deep Calling]] is recommended to knock out the Crabs, as well as recharge nearby players' light.

Light the rotating panel in the center to raise the Elder's altar. Lighting up the three candles of the altar will bring up a meditating circle where you can sit to meet the [[Elder of the Forest]] in a cutscene and open the two large doors leading to the [[#Forest End|Forest End]].

In the Forest Temple, players can find: 
*1 [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]]

==Forest End==
[[File:Forest ForestEnd1.png|right|300px]]
While still technically part of the [[#Temple|Forest Temple]] area, the general scheme differs greatly from the Temple. This is a bright place with many light creatures, offering a space to relax and a few extra benches to converse with other players. Use the [[Jellyfish]] (or the [[Butterflies]] via [[Deep Call]]) and fly up and out through the cloud tunnel, completing Hidden Forest and flying up to the next Realm, the [[Valley of Triumph]].

In the Forest End, players can find:  
* 1 [[Children_of_Light#Forest End|Child of Light]]
*1 [[Map Shrine#Hidden Forest|Map Shrine]]

Shared Space Shrines are accessible to all players who have progressed to Daylight Prairie. You can have up to 16 Props placed at a time in your Shared Space, but it can be much less depending on the "volume" of the Props as determined by how much the top bar fills up. Within the Forest Shared Spaces, there are [[Shared Spaces#Featured Props|featured Props]] given to the player to place regardless of if it is owned, being the {{Spirit Item|Scaredy Cadet|Prop|inline_text}}, {{Icon|Shared-Spaces-Standing-Lantern-prop-icon-Morybel-0146.png|inline_text|link=Shared Spaces#Shared Spaces Standing Lantern|label=Shared Spaces Standing Lantern}}, and {{Spirit Item|Assembly Guide|prop_t|inline_text|link=Assembly Guide#Tent Prop|label=Assembly Guide Tent}}.

==Seasonal Content==
In Hidden Forest, [[Seasonal Spirits]] from the Season of {{Season Icon|gratitude|inline_text|label=Gratitude}}, {{Season Icon|lightseekers|inline_text|label=Lightseekers}}, {{Season Icon|belonging|inline_text|label=Belonging}}, {{Season Icon|rhythm|inline_text|label=Rhythm}}, {{Season Icon|assembly|inline_text|label=Assembly}}, and {{Season Icon|flight|inline_text|label=Flight}} can be found scattered around the Realm. Collecting the Seasonal Spirits do not count towards unlocking Forest's Spirit Gates. You will be able to collect their base level Emotes, but in order to collect the Cosmetics or Expression upgrades, you will have to wait for the Spirit to return as a [[Traveling Spirit]]. Anything bought from their Friendship Trees do not count towards [[Constellations|Forest's Constellation]] progression.

{{Spirit Group|forest|type=seasonal|format=gallery}}

In addition, Seasonal Quests from {{Season Icon|assembly|inline_text}} can be completed to decorate [[The Treehouse]].

*The Underground Caverns are featured in a piece of merch from thatskyshop, in the form of the [[That Sky Shop/Wave 2#Hidden Portal of the Forest Pin|Hidden Portal of the Forest Pin]]. It has a [[STAR]] feature which allows you and the friends that you're holding hands with to teleport to the Underground Caverns in the Hidden Forest.
