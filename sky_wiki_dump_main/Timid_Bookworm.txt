== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|fBs1TfQLRPM||inline|Video Guide}}

The Timid Bookworm can be found in the [[Sanctuary Islands]], on the underside and on the back of the first floating island when entering the area from the Bird Nest. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 15-minute [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Timid Bookworm can be seen sitting on the ground with a book before they spot the [[Sanctuary Guide]] a few steps away, which is holding out their hand in the air. They approach the Guide carefully and observe how a butterfly sits on their outstretched hand. The two Spirits then make their way up the floating island, stopping at a floating Jellyfish once, before arriving at the very top, where a big swarm of butterflies flocks around the Sanctuary Guide, while the Timid Bookworm watches in awe a few steps away.

At the end of the memory, the Timid Bookworm sits quietly near the Sanctuary Guide, reading a book. The Sanctuary Guide holds out their left palm to allow a butterfly to land, which makes the Timid Bookworm look up from their book and stand up, shyly holding their right arm. The butterfly then flutters away from the Guide and the Timid Bookworm reaches up with both arms to try and catch it, but the little creature has already flown out of their reach. A little embarrassed, the Timid Bookworm shyly holds their right arm.<br>
