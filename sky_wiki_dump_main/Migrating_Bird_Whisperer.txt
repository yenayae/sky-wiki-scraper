== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|7kk8VV1-g8A|200px|inline|Video Guide}}

The Migrating Bird Whisperer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], at the top of a floating island, left of the main island. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 12-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Bird Whisperer can be seen sitting in the gras alongside the [[Light Whisperer]], watching [[Birds]] fly by. Suddenly, the Spirits jump to their feet as they spot an injured Bird, separated from the flock, just above their island. The Migrating Bird Whisperer quickly runs towards the Bird and gently catches it. They bring it to the base of the small island, inside the Light Whisperer's workshop, where they carefully placd the Bird on a pillow. After some rest, the Spirits bring the Bird outside and let it fly free, where it is welcomed by their flock. Uplifted by their good deed, the Bird Whisperer frolicks across the field, before they stop and watch the swarm fly away, touched by this wonderful moment.

At the end of the memory, the Migrating Bird Whisperer happily runs across the grass before watching the huge swarm of Birds fly across the sky, completely in awe. Touched by this wonderful moment, they place their hands above their heart.

*Level 1 will make your avatar hold out their arms straight to each side and relax their eyes. This Expression will temporarily replace your basic walk and can be canceled by jumping or flying up once. When moved, your avatar will run around while slightly swaying their arms up and down.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with trails of small golden sparkles following the avatar's hands.
*Level 3 makes the same motion as Level 1, except that the motion is slower and the avatar flaps their arms up and down, as if imitating a butterfly.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with sparkles appearing at the hands during the initial motion and yellow glowing lights trailing them with each flap.
<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
