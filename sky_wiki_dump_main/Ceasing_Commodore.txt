<div>
{{#ev:youtube|Gnq2NahwTLU||inline|Video Guide}}
<div>
The Ceasing Commodore can be found by flying over the back end of the hill where you first arrive, behind the Abyss Guide's ship. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. <br>
<br>
As their memory unfolds, the Ceasing Commodore and the [[Abyss Guide]] can be seen going on a search for black crystals. On their search through the island, they spot two crystals at different places, and assemble them in a bucket the Abyss Guide carries, while the Commodore looks for new findings. A bit further on their way, the two adventurers spot another crystal at the top of a tower. The Abyss Guide immediately tries to climb up the wall, but the Ceasing Commodore calmly stops them, volunteering to scale the tower instead.

The remaining memory fragments may be a little difficult to gather if you don‚Äôt have enough Cape Power, as they are placed high up on the tower wall. Use a [[Deep Call]] to summon the nearby butterflies, and let yourself be carried up the tower, where a [[Flora, Minerals and Elements of Sky#Light Bloom|Light Bloom]] on the wall can be used to recharge your Wings and help you stay there.

At the end of the memory, the Ceasing Commodore calms the Abyss Guide's determination to climb the tower. Executing what the Abyss Guide had intended to do, the Ceasing Commodore later hangs from the top ledge of the tower, triumphantly holding the large crystal above their head, while the Abyss Guide, watching from below, jumps up delight.<br>
