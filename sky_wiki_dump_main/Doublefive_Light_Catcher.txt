The Doublefive Light Catcher is found on the central floating island of the [[Daylight Prairie#Bird's Nest|Bird's Nest]], behind the smallest tower, on the player's left when entering by the Butterfly Fields entrance. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 4 memory fragements and a 6-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
This Spirit memory is relatively easy, with the only difficult portion involving carrying the light to the top of the broken tower, since part of the wall is missing. This portion can either be completed by using the advanced technique of carrying the light by flying, or by making their way up from inside the broken tower, jumping across a series of planks. 

As their memory unfolds, the Doublefive Light Catcher can be seen playing the flute with a friend as they make their way to the top of the broken tower. The last fragment shows the Spirits sharing a double high five. <br>

Doublefive-Light-Catcher-double-five-emote-level-2.gif|{{Icon Name||emote_name}} Level 2
</gallery>
*Level 1 will make your avatar hold out their hands, palms facing up, and crouch infront of your friend, which will raise their arms and slam them down to slap both your avatar's hands, before turning with a little jump, their back facing you, and face their palms up behind their back, before your avatar slaps your friend's hands after raising their arms and slamming them down.
* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with white sparkles bursting from the avatar's hands on impact of the slaps.

Like any [[Friendship Menu#Extended Two-Player Abilities|Extended Two-Player Abilities]], this ability can be upgraded by opening your friend's Friendship Menu. To reach the 5th node before the ability, it will cost you {{Cost|6 C}} and {{Cost|1 AC}}. (See [[Friendship Menu]] to view the entire Friendship Tree). Unlocking the Level 1 ability will cost you {{Cost|3 C}}. After unlocking Level 1, it will cost you {{Cost|4 C}} more to upgrade to Level 2.

As a Traveling Spirit, the price of the Friend Action upgrade was {{Cost|7 H}}. During the Season, Level 1 was free, but Level 2 was only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
