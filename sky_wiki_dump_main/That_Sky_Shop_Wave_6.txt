! Dark Dragon Plush Usage Tips
|-
|
*The eye of the Dark Dragon Plush is metal, coated with thermochromic paint, which presents different colors at different temperatures.
*In the process of color change, the color of the eye may appear speckled, uneven, purple, etc. Once the temperature of the color change is stabilized, the best effect can be achieved.
*Please store the plush in a cool and dry place. High temperature, exposure to the sun, and grease will affect the durability of the thermochromic paint layer.
*Please avoid heavy pressure and impact with hard surfaces on the thermochromic paint.
