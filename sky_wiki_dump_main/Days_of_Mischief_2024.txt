Days of Mischief returned for a sixth year in a row—and this time, the Spirits of the [[Cackling Crab]] have gotten in over their heads and need your help! The event began on '''Monday, October 21, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and continued until '''Sunday, November 10, 2024 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''21''' days. For the duration of the event, the Herald of Mischief appeared in [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to the [[Cackling Crab]]. In addition, the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate.

The [[The Cackling Crab#NPC Shopkeepers|Mischief Spirits]] tried to bring a new guest to the skies above the caves, but unfortunately something went wrong, and now creatures that were far more [[#Dark Shadows|dark and shadowy]] had shown up. In each of the event’s three weekly phases, the Spirits asked players to lend a hand to keep the chaos at bay:

* '''1st Week:''' The Spirits' attempt to summon the Mischief Raven goes wrong, unleashing [[Dark Shadows]] upon the Cackling Crab. While the Spirits work to prepare [[#Mischief Withered Broom|flying brooms]] to rescue the Raven, players are tasked with confronting the shadowy creatures using cannons.
* '''2nd Week:''' Players can freely borrow a broom from the [[#The Cackling Crab#Underground Lair|underground lair]] in the Cackling Crab, and [[The Cackling Crab#Nat|Nat]] offers flying practice that rewards a bit of [[Pieces of Light|Light]].
* '''3rd Week:''' The Spirits lead a final charge against the Dark Shadows, gathering a fleet of Sky Kids on brooms with [[Festival Tech]] to banish the Dark Shadows for good and free their beloved Raven.

Help them take care of what they’ve brought in, and you can find [[#Ticket Locations|Event Currency Light]] in the process too! There are plenty of activities above the Cackling Crab to enjoy, but don’t forget to also explore what the caves below hold. You’ll find new and returning favorites from years past in every nook and cranny. With tricks, pranks, Spells, and transformations galore, there’s plenty for everyone to enjoy during ''Sky''’s spookiest event of the year!

===Dark Shadows===
[[File:Days-of-Mischief-Cannon-Blast-Dark-Shadow.gif|thumb|250px|right|Blasting a Dark Shadow]]
This year, the [[The Cackling Crab#NPC_Shopkeepers|Mischief Spirits]] have accidentally unleashed something that is far more dark and shadowy than they intended: multiple [[Dark Shadows]] that now swirl in the skies above the [[Cackling Crab]]. Unlike the Dark Shadows found in the [[Season of Prophecy#The Trial of Fire|Trial of Fire]], these Dark Shadows do not extinguish the player's Light. Instead, they place the [[#Krill Cat's Curse Spell|Krill Cat's Curse Spell]] on any players they touch, the effects of which can be cancelled at any time by double tapping the [[Spell]]'s icon, found in the bottom left corner of the screen or by viewing the top of the [[Expression Menu|Blessing Submenu]].

Help the Mischief Spirits fight back against the Dark Shadows by using the three cannons placed on the cliffs behind the [[The Cackling Crab#The Entrance|entrance pit]], near where players initially arrive when teleporting to the area. Interact with the mouth of a cannon to load it up with coal and then wait for a Dark Shadow to approach. When the light on the back of the cannon begins to flash red, quickly use your [[Flame]] to light the cannon and blast the shadowy creature. Each day, all three Dark Shadows will drop a one-time reward of regular [[Pieces of Light|Light]] when defeated, and then begin to drop green [[#Ticket Locations|Event Currency Light]] for a short period of time. Once they recover, the Dark Shadows can be blasted again to continue collecting Event Currency Light for a total of 5 Tickets each day.

===Ticket Locations===
[[File:Days-of-Mischief-Event-Currency-Light.png|125px|thumb|Days of Mischief Event Currency Light]]
For the duration of the event, '''all [[Currency#Event Currency|Event Currency]] were available as Event Currency Light'''. They appeared as green orbs that are similar in appearance to [[Pieces of Light|Light]] from Candles. It filled up the Event Currency meter the same way that regular Light fills the [[Currency#Candles|Candle]] meter, and players could forge a unit of Event Currency once the meter was full.

A total of {{Cost|5 T|event=mischief}} Tickets could be collected each day by participating in activities that help the Mischief Spirits:

*{{Cost|5 T|event=mischief}} by blasting [[#Dark Shadows|Dark Shadows]] with the cannons above the [[Cackling Crab]] (Week 1)<!--
*{{Cost|5 T|event=mischief}} ... method to obtain ... (Week 2)
*{{Cost|5 T|event=mischief}} ... method to obtain ... (Week 3) -->

Players could also buy additional Tickets (costing {{Cost|2 AC}} or {{Cost|6 C}} each) from the Spell Shop at [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Aviary Village]] and Sleepy Traveler's boat at [[Home]].

===2024 New Cosmetics and Props===
====Mischief Withered Broom====
::'''''"Let your bewitching dreams take flight!"'''''
The Mischief Withered Broom has a dark branch handle with a few orange leaves still attached and light brown bristles. When equipped, it allows the player to ride the broom while flying and moving on the ground. Although this item does not provide any additional speed, it does allow the player to glide farther without losing as much height compared to regular flying. It also allows players to remain seated on the broom while moving between different areas and while holding out their [[Flame]]. This [[Prop]] cannot be placed and therefore cannot be used in [[Shared Spaces]]. When carried on its owner's back, the Prop appears in its original form. This Prop was introduced in 2024 and was available for {{Cost|19.99 USD|refnote}} from the [[Premium Candle Shop]] for the duration of the event.<br>

The Mischief Cauldron is a large, round, gray cauldron filled with a bubbling green liquid that sits on a pile of logs, decorated with three stone cups on the rim.

When carried on its owner's back, the Prop appears in its original form.
