The Stretching Guru can be found in the large central cavern of the [[Prairie Caves]], on a stepped hill to the player's left when entering from the [[Butterfly Fields]]. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

Note that certain memory fragments require flying and carrying the light into the air to advance. 

As their memory unfolds, the Stretching Guru can be seen moving across the cave and up the stepped slope on the other side, dancing and striking poses. The memory ends outside the tunnel leading to the [[Social Light|Cozy Hideout]].

At the end of the memory, the Stretching Guru lowers their head before stretching their arms upwards, making their hands meet at the top.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar lower their head before stretching their arms out above their head and touch their hands together, while instrumental notes play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a white ring of light encircling each of your avatar's hands.
*Level 3 will make your avatar perform the same motion as in Level 1 but at a quicker pace, before letting their upper body fall down, hands still joined together, and stand up straight again with their arms swinging up with the motion, while instrumental notes play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a white ring of light encircling each of your avatar's hands during the first half of the Expression.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

==Cosmetics==
===Hair===
The [[Hair]] offered by this Spirit is a wide, orange, cone-shaped hat with a yellow tip, sitting on tied-up hair, costing {{Cost|26 C}} from the Traveling Spirit. It was available to all players during the Season from the Friendship Tree's second node ({{Cost|6 SC|season=Gratitude}} total).
