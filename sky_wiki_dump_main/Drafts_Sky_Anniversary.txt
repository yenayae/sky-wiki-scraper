'''Sky Anniversary''' (also known as '''Days of Sky''') is an annual event celebrating the game's anniversary that happens around mid-July for two weeks in July. The [[Secret Area]] is open to everybody during this event, featuring extra decorations and an Anniversary Guide at the entrance. As part of the celebrations, numbered [[collectibles]] that are tied to their specific anniversary year are available to collect—and just like a birthday, they'll only come once!<ref name="Numbered items">"As you may know from past events, numbered items for specific birthday years are only available for their given year. After all, you can’t turn five twice!" - {{v|0.26.0}} Patch Notes</ref>

Special activities added to the [[Secret Area]] during this event include:
*Small, ark-like boats which players can activate and ride, spreading confetti in the Office space.
*Players can do the [[Boogie_Kid#Expression|Boogie Dance]] on a piece of floating pizza.
*The [[Dark Crabs|Crabs]] wear party hats.
