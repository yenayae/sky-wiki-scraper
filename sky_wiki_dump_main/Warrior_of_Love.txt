*Level 1 will make your avatar twirl around, pulling their arms out elegantly with the motion, before stopping softly and gently flicking up their hands while bright harp notes play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with golden sparks following the hands in a trail and a small burst of rose-colored sparks at the end.
*Level 3 will make your avatar take a small step back and twirl around several times, moving their arms freely and gracefully, before striking a final pose, while layered bright harp notes play, ended with a small "bing!".
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with golden sparkles following the hands in a trail and a few white orbs circling the avatar's body in rhythm with their motion.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

==Trivia==
*The Warrior of Love is named after the song “''Warrior''” by AURORA, the eighth track in her album “''All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend''”, which is also the song that plays during the Spirit's Quest and in Music Sheet #35.
*When the Warrior of Love's {{Emote||inline_text}} [[Expression]] is used in the presence of [[butterflies]], they will gather around the player's avatar and turn around with them.
