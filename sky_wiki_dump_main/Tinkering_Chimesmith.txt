<div>{{#ev:youtube|ddTD2kkI5f8||inline|Video Guide}}

The Tinkering Chimesmith can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on a set of stone steps on the main island, next to the [[Flight Guide]]. When entering from the area's main entrance, let yourself be guided by the wind and fly straight until you arrive at the main island. Your landing point should be at or near the bottom of a set of stone steps near the Flight Guide, at the top of which the Tinkering Chimesmith can be found. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 10 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Tinkering Chimesmith can be seen climbing up the stone steps, hanging chimes from each stone arch on their way up the mountain. On the second arch, they drop their hammer while hanging the wind chimes but they continue their work and travel on upwards, where they reach the top of the mountain, which holds a big stone arch. The Spirit pauses at the foot of the stone arch and uses their hands to measure where they want their bells to hang from. Once their work is finally - and successfully - done, the Chimesmith stores their tool on a [[Manta]]-driven boat and boards it, before taking off in direction of another, smaller island, not far away. This island, which is positioned at a higher altitude than the [[Talented Builder]]'s neighboring island, is home to their workshop, where they are seen pondering their work and curling up next to their worktable. After a little rest, the Spirit continues their work by tinkering with the chimes hanging from the pillars supporting their little abode and observing them from below.

At the end of the memory, the Tinkering Chimesmith stands beneath the wind chimes hanging in their workshop, which clank and ring against one another, creating a beautiful melody. Lost in thought, the Spirit observes the chimes while enjoying the wonderful sounds.<br>
