The Rejecting Voyager can be found in front of a cave, left of the [[Isle of Dawn#Temple|Isle's Temple]] entrance. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 3 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Rejecting Voyager is seen guiding another Spirit carrying a pickaxe further down the tunnel. The pickaxe wielding Spirit pauses to point at a blank section of the wall, to which the Rejecting Voyager denies by crossing their arms in an "X". The pair moves on to another section of wall that features a [[Murals|Mural]] of the [[Elder of the Isle]] surrounded by flying [[Creatures]].

At the end of the memory, the Rejecting Voyager gestures towards the Mural and confirms it to also be off limits to the Spirit with a pickaxe, firmly shaking their head and waving both arms in a negative motion.<br>

==Trivia==
*[[Darkness|Darkness Plants]] covering the two ground entrances to the [[Tearful Light Miner]]'s cave, Darkness Plants on the [[Whale Whisperer]] covering the skeleton of the [[Boneyard]], and in the Rejecting Voyager's cave Darkness Plants in [[Isle of Dawn]] are Darknesses that cannot be burned by players with not enough [[Winged Lights]]. If a player try to burn Darkness Plants with less than 3 wedges for Whale Whisperer, less than 2 for Rejecting Voyager, and less than 1 for Tearful Light Miner, will receive a message that says, "You need more {{Icon|Four-point-star-Ray.png|link=}} to melt this."
