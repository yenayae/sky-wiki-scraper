==Overview==
The Sanctuary Islands evoke the feeling of a summer island paradise – inhabited by numerous Jellyfish, Crabs, and Mantas. Fresh features include waterfalls, sandy shores, geysers, beach chairs, sea caves, and floating islands that hang from the surrounding skies. A unique feature to the area are the geysers, allowing players to rocket high up while also recharging their capes.

On the far side of the main island, players will see a mysterious stone monument which houses six broken bells. Standing nearby is the [[Sanctuary Guide]] who longingly watches over the ruined structure. There are 6 Seasonal Spirits, which upon completing, will give you their unique [[Expression]]. Additionally, there is a [https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Map_Shrines?file=Prairie-Sanctuary-Island-Map-Shrine.jpg Map Shrine] located next to the Sanctuary Guide.

===Child of Light Locations===

In the Sanctuary Islands, Seasonal Quests from [[Season of Sanctuary]] are available to do, a series of treasure hunts to find bells to bring [[Light Creatures]] to the islands. There are 6 quests, each trial brings a new light creature to the islands, and cannot be replayed. Players must gather Memory Fragments to help the Spirit restore the ruined stone monument nearby. The fragments are found in the form of large golden bells which are strewn throughout the islands. Embark on a treasure hunt to find them all.

*The Sanctuary Islands came out July 6, 2020
*The Polluted Geyser is supposed to mimic the pollution of real oceans
*Sanctuary Islands were used as the [[Days of Nature|Days of Nature 2021-2023]] event space, adding the Polluted Geyser, Sunset Turtle, and [[Days of Nature#Daily Quest|The Great Vortex]] to the area.
* The Sanctuary Islands area is featured in a piece of merch from thatskyshop, in the form of the [[That Sky Shop/Wave 12#Sanctuary Islands Pin|Sanctuary Islands Pin]]. It has a STAR feature which allows you and the friends holding your hand to teleport to the Sanctuary Islands.
