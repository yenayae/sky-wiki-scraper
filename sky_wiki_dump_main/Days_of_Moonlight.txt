'''Days of Moonlight''' is an annual event celebrating the moon where players gather together to share peaceful moments, memorable riddles, and admire the full moon. It was first introduced in 2024, following after [[Days of Sunlight]].

During the two-week event, the Moonlight Guide appears in [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to the [[Crescent Oasis#Hidden Glade|Hidden Glade]] in the Vault of Knowledge, which was newly decorated for the occasion. A silvery moon shines above the stately tree that calls the Oasis home, and nearby paper lanterns are ready to create a magical atmosphere. Beneath a starry sky, hanging lanterns invite you to [[Days of Moonlight#Riddle Lanterns|create a riddle]] for fellow Sky Children to solve.

Moonlight-themed [[IAP]]s are available from the in-game shop, and the Moonlight Guide Spirit offers various cosmetics from their Friendship Tree. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the Gift Box at [[Crescent Oasis#Hidden Glade|Hidden Glade]].

{{#ev:youtube|Q1MPrDLo9b4||right|Days of Moonlight 2025 Trailer}}
A silver moon rose over a serene landscape, calling Sky kids to share peaceful moments, memorable riddles, and perhaps even some… transformative moments.

Days of Moonlight returned from '''Monday, September 29, 2025 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' through '''Sunday, October 12, 2025 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Moonlight Guide appeared at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to warp players to a starry-skied version of the [[Crescent Oasis#Hidden Glade|Crescent Oasis's Hidden Glade]]. 

There, players could share [[#Riddle Lanterns|riddles]] with others and try their hand at answering a few of their own. The Moonlight Pavilion was introduced this year, and hosted new event experiences, including: a table with mooncakes, a meditation circle, and a dock. The mooncakes offered a [[Days of Moonlight#Moonlight Rabbit Form Spell|surprising twist]] on the event experience. The new meditation circle warped players into a tranquil void where an Asian-inspired structure stood at the heart of the scene. Surrounded by golden shrubs and drifting lily pads, the moonlit Pavilion rested beneath the glow of an enormous full moon, radiating a cold yet breathtaking light. At the end of the dock, players could use a [[Blessings (Spells)#Message Lantern Spell|message lantern]] to write for a loved one, and release it out onto the water. 

Beginning with this year's Days of Moonlight, three items from other events are now available: 
*the [[#Moonlight Lantern Pack|Lantern Pack]] (from [[Days of Summer Lights#September 2020|Days of Summer Lights 2020]]<!--<ref name="Days of Summer Lights"></ref>-->), 
*the [[#Moonlight Bunny Accessory|Bunny Accessory]] (from [[Days of Summer Lights#September 2021|Days of Summer Lights 2021]]<!--<ref name="Days of Summer Lights"></ref>-->), and 
*the [[#Moonlight Bunny Slippers|Bunny Slippers]] (from [[Days of Style#October 2023|Days of Style 2023]]<!--<ref name="Days of Style"></ref>-->)

===2025 New Spell===
====Moonlight Rabbit Form Spell====
By {{Icon|Eat-cookie-icon.png}} eating a mooncake from the Tea Table in the Moonlight Pavilion at the [[Crescent Oasis#Hidden Glade|Hidden Glade]], the player is temporarily transformed into a bunny, resembling the [[Days of Moonlight#Moonlight Bunny Accessory|Bunny Accessory]]. In this form, players appear as a round bunny that moves forward by bouncing instead of walking. While the [[Spell]] is active, some actions are limited, such as flying, using [[Expressions]], or carrying [[Props]]. The Spell is mainly used for playful movement during seasonal celebrations. The Spell's duration is '''15 minutes'''.<br><br>

==September 2024==
'''Days of Moonlight''' made its debut, inviting players to revel in the beauty of a full moon and the light of glowing lanterns! The event began on '''Monday, September 16, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and continued until '''Sunday, September 29, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Moonlight Guide appeared in [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to the [[Crescent Oasis#Hidden Glade|Hidden Glade]] in the Vault of Knowledge, which was newly decorated for the occasion.

A silvery moon shined above the stately tree that calls the Oasis home, and nearby paper lanterns were ready to create a magical atmosphere. Beneath the starry sky, hanging lanterns invited players to [[Days of Moonlight#Riddle Lanterns|create a riddle]] for fellow Sky Children to solve. Or perhaps they'd rather view what riddles others had written—browsing among the lanterns, then answering riddles, gave Event Currency to purchase [[Days of Moonlight#All Available Collectibles|themed cosmetics]]. It might just have helped the players see the world around them in new and surprising ways, too! And when players needed a break from exploring the breathtaking scenery, they could stop by the nearby table with snacks to enjoy a bit of extra [[Pieces of Light|Light]].

Life can be hectic, and sometimes what's needed is a peaceful evening to take in the beauty of the space around. This was a chance to slow down, reflect, and take in a peaceful evening with friends among the glowing lanterns and glittering stars.

::'''''"Each year, when the moon reaches its fullest phase, an old tradition returns to the Sky Realm. During this time, we gather together to solve riddles, eat snacks, and admire the full moon."'''''

===Riddle Lanterns===
<!-- [[File:File-Name.png|thumb|x150px|The Riddle Lanterns]] // Clean screenshot of the lanterns + desk TBA-->
For the duration of the event, players could create custom riddles and answer those written by other players through the paper lanterns hanging next to the golden tree in the [[Crescent Oasis#Hidden Glade|Hidden Glade]]. Similar to other [[Player Creations]], messages left using these lanterns could be opened, liked, hidden, and reported.<!-- Once placed, they remain for a total of ? days (?? hours) before disappearing. -->

To create a riddle, interact with the nearby desk and submit both a riddle and its answer into the prompt menu. Once done, the created riddle will appear as a hanging paper lantern that other players can find and view. Each player can only place one riddle lantern at a time.

When interacting with a hanging riddle lantern, players will be unable to view any answers submitted by other players until they submit their own answer to the riddle. Entering an answer will also light a flame inside the lantern. Each day, players could earn up to 3 [[#Ticket Locations|Tickets]] to exchange for themed IGC (in-game currency) items by submitting answers to other players' riddles.

Note: Riddle lanterns, unlike other meditation [[Daily Quests]] or Seasonal Quests, will not appear if "Disable Chat Online" is turned on in your device's settings.
