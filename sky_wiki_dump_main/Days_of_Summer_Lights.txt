To celebrate the nostalgia of past summer nights—and anticipation of those to come—Days of Summer Lights began <section begin="2020 Dates" />'''Tuesday, September 8, 2020 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended '''Sunday, September 20, 2020 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)'''<section end="2020 Dates" />. TGC worked together with the community to bring this event to the game.

The Sleepy Traveling Merchant offered free Spell versions of all of the event items on their boat. Players could get 3 [[#Message Boat Spells|Message Boats]] and 2 [[#Days of Summer Lights Pack|Lanterns]] free every six days. ''Each of these temporary Spells last for 10 minutes.''
