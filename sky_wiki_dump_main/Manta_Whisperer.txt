The Manta Whisperer can be found in the [[Citadel]], on a low platform on the right side of the building. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 8 memory fragments and a 5-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Manta Whisperer reaches out towards the sky as a light fragment, possibly representing a [[Mantas|Manta]], flies all around the Citadel, weaving through the various structures.

At the end of the memory, the Manta Whisperer lets out a warbling Manta honk, drawing out several large Mantas from the clouds obscuring the ground.<br>

== <span id="Expression">Call</span> ==
The Manta Whisperer does not offer an [[Expression]], but instead offers a [[Call]]. The {{Emote||inline_text}} modifies the player's voice to a bubbly honk.

''Unlocking this Call is a prerequisite to learning the {{Emote|Cosmic Manta Call|inline_text}} from [[Memory Whisperer]].''<br>
