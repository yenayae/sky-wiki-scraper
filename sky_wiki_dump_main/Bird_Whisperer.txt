The Bird Whisperer can be found in the [[Bird Nest]], on the right-hand floating island with a hole through it, at the base of the ruined tower. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Bird Whisperer is seen carefully ascending the tower, winding around the ruined building to reach the very top. Following them can be a little tricky since any platforms to land on are quite small. The player can either make use of guided movement by walking in the direction of the desired platform and letting the game jump for them, or by expending some Cape Energy to fly directly to the memory fragments.

At the end of the memory, the {{PAGENAME}} perches on top of the tower, admiring the many [[Birds]] flying past. The Spirit sprinkles food around them and whistles (not the same sound as the [[#Call|Bird Call]] given by them) which attracts a single Bird. It lands to peck around a little bit before chirping and flying away.<br>
