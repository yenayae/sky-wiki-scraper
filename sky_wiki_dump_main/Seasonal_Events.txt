[[File:SoMigration-Teaser-image.png|alt=|thumb|250px|Next Season Teaser]]
'''Seasonal Events''' are limited-time themed events that come with the option of purchasing an [[Seasonal Events#Season Pass|Season Pass]], which allows players to access extra [[Cosmetics]] and [[Expressions]] during the Season in exchange for an in-game purchase.

Use the [[Seasonal_Events/Calculator|Sky Seasonal Candle Calculator]] to figure out how many Seasonal Candles you need to collect all the Cosmetics in the Season.

==Seasonal Events==
Seasonal Events are a continuous feature in Sky! Each Season lasts around nine to eleven weeks. During this time, a limited number of Expressions, Cosmetics, Props, Instruments, Calls, and Stances are accessible from Seasonal Spirits.

During each Season, a new Constellation appears on the [[Constellation Table]] at Home and Aviary Village; it is located between Hidden Forest and Valley of Triumph. This Seasonal Constellation holds the [[Seasonal_Spirits#Seasonal_Spirit_Trees|Friendship Trees]] of the current Season's Spirits, offering Cosmetics and other various items that can be unlocked with the [[Currency#Season_Candles|Season Candle Currency]] earned during the Season. If players do not purchase the Season Pass, only about half of these will be purchasable. However, previous Seasonal Spirits return as [[Traveling Spirits]] – offering past Cosmetics and Expressions for non-Seasonal Currencies.

Seasons, and the Seasonal Spirits themselves, always follow a set theme and aesthetic. For instance, the Season of Belonging brought with it a family of Seasonal Spirits that the player had to collect and reunite.

Starting from the Season of Enchantment, Seasonal Spirits can be found in the new sub-Realms instead of six main [[Realms]] and the [[Ancestors#Guides|Seasonal Guide]] offers Quests.

<small><nowiki>''</nowiki>Note: Seasons have a minimum game completion requirement before the players is able to enter the new location. Please refer to the Seasonal page if you are unable to access the entry point.<nowiki>''</nowiki></small>  

The Season Guide during the active Season gives out Season Candles (see below) as a reward for completing [[Daily Quests]]. This Spirit will also wear and sell the Ultimate Gifts of the Season, purchasable for Seasonal Hearts.

'''With the July 2021 update to Sky: Children of the Light, all Seasonal Spirits from past and current Seasons are now visible in every Realm of the Sky Kingdom. ''Once a player has finished the final level (Eye of Eden) of the game at least once,'' it will now be possible to find and collect the base-level Expression from all Seasonal Spirits. However, in order to collect the Cosmetic items or upgrade the Expressions, the player will have to wait for those Spirits to return as [[Traveling Spirits]].'''

== Season Currencies ==
===Season Candles===
[[File:Prophecy-Candles.jpeg|right|thumb|The Season Candles featured in the Season of Prophecy]]
Season Candles are the currency during a Seasonal Event. They are similar to the regular white Candles, except they are golden and feature the emblem of the current Season. Each Seasonal Event's Candles used to have their own unique color relating to the Season, but this is no longer the case.

Season Candles are rewarded by the Return Shrine Statue at Home and Aviary Village. Every day during the Season, a new set of Quests is available to complete, and the player receives one Season Candle per Quest completed. Season Candles are also sprinkled in one area of the main Realm of the day (whichever Realm the Daily Quests take place) and players can earn an extra Season Candle from collecting the wax from all four of these dotted about the Realm. Sometimes there is a Double Candle event where twice the amount of Season Candles can be found, meaning players instead have the opportunity to get two extra Season Candles.
{{Clear}}

====Season Candle Quests====
[[File:Bluecandle.JPG|right|thumb|The Season Candles featured in the Season of Lightseekers. Note the blue color.]]
Completing the Seasonal Quests is the quickest way to accumulate Season Candles, whether you purchase the Season Pass or not. Since Spring 2019's "Season of Gratitude," the Quests now focus on one area of the game per day. There are four tasks to complete each day, which can all be done in the daily Realm. However, some can be achieved in other areas. Read more on the [[Quests]] page.

You can tap the top left corner of your screen to see what Quests you have completed and to complete at any given time.
{{Clear}}
===Season Hearts===
Introduced with the Season of Belonging, '''Season Hearts '''are a currency used during Seasonal Events.

They are used to exchange for Seasonal Ultimate Gifts from the Season Guide Spirit. This is the only purpose/use of Season Hearts. During a Season, these can be obtained in the Seasonal Constellation from each Seasonal Spirit's tree. A Season Heart will be located at the top of each tree (meaning a player will have to purchase everything from that Spirit to reach the Heart), it will cost 3 Season Candles, and can '''only '''be unlocked for those with the Season Pass. When a Seasonal Event concludes, '''any unused Season Hearts convert to regular Hearts (1:1).'''

==Season Pass==
[[File:SoG AP1.png|thumb|220x220px|The Season Pass for Season of Gratitude (Summer 2019)]]
The Season Pass was originally called the Adventure Pass but was renamed after Patch {{v|0.18.0}}.

The rewards from the Seasonal Spirits are divided into two tiers, a free tier and the Season Pass tier. If the player has purchased the Season Pass, the player will be able to unlock an extra reward for free with each item purchased in the Seasonal Spirits' Shops. Players can also purchase a Gift Pack that includes one Season Pass for the player, and two extra Passes to gift to friends (previously called the Gratitude Pack). The standalone Season Pass is available for $9.99 USD, the bundle $19.99 USD. When gifting a pass, the recipient will also receive the 30 Season Candles a normal pass provides. It is also possible to gift further individual passes, in addition to the bundle, for the price of $9.99 USD.

Please note: a Season Pass is good for only one Season - the Seasonal Event that it was bought for. The Season Pass will need to be purchased new for each Season, if desired. However, leftover gift-passes will not expire if left unused. 

The Season Pass can be purchased in the same store that you buy Candles from, and as of February 2020 provides the following benefits:

*Seasonal pendant Cosmetic available for players to wear and keep after the Seasonal Event
*One additional daily Season Candle (available at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]])
*30 Seasonal Candles
*One free item for every purchased one
Players that did not purchase the Season Pass cannot unlock nodes that have the Seasonal icon mark next to them in the Spirit's Friendship Tree (usually, locked cosmetics are on the left side of the Tree). Players may upgrade their accounts to unlock the Season Pass and its bonus rewards at any time during the Seasonal Event.

===Gift Season Pass===
[[File:Adventure-pass-icon-generic.png|right|thumb|A generic icon for a Gift Season Pass]]
Usually referred to as a Gift Pass, this item allows the player to gift a Season Pass to a friend through an option in the [[Friendship_Menu#Gift_Season_Pass|Friendship Menu]].

Gift Passes must be gifted to a friend. They cannot be used for oneself. Additionally, the players must have been friends for 72 hours, and the friend cannot already have a Season Pass for the current active season. Unused Gift Passes '''do not expire'''. They continue to roll over to the next season until gifted. Two players with unused Gift Passes from a previous season can gift those passes to each other without first owning the pass for the current season.

Receiving a Season Pass from a Gift Pass comes with all the same perks as buying a Season Pass directly.
*Seasonal pendant Cosmetic available for players to wear and keep after the Seasonal Event
*One additional daily Season Candle (available at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]])
*30 Seasonal Candles
*One free item for every purchased one

Gift Passes can be obtained a few ways.
*[[Premium_Candle_Shop#Seasonal_Packs|Seasonal Packs]]
**Season Pass Bundle
**Gift Pack
*Certain IAP Packs
**[[Days_of_Bloom#Bloom_Picnic_Basket|Bloom Picnic Basket]]

===Season Pass Preorders===
In the days leading up to the Season of Enchantment in April 2020, players were given the chance to preorder Season Passes for the upcoming Season.  '''However, this option has been retired in Patch {{v|0.15.5}}.''' Starting from Season of Abyss (2022), Season Pass Preorders are no longer available. All Season Passes will now include 30 Seasonal Candles and this includes Passes a player receives as a gift as well. 

The preorder option was available for approximately one week before the Season of Sanctuary began, it was delayed by a bug that caused the Season of Enchantment pendant to become unlocked as an accessory instead of the Pendant of Sanctuary. Preorders were available for both the individual pass as well as for the bundle. Preorders contained an additional ten Seasonal Candles on top of the 20 that they would normally have, for a total of 30 Seasonal Candles. Only the purchaser got the ten extra Candles.

===Seasonal Gift Packs===
Previously, Seasonal Gift Packs were also available from the Store. These allowed players to access currently unavailable Seasonal Cosmetics though an in-app purchase. However, as of the Season of Enchantment, and the continued existence of [[Traveling Spirits]], '''Seasonal Gift Packs are no longer available.'''

Until January 2020, the Gift Pack on offer was the Winter Musician Pack, which included Cosmetics and Music Sheets from the Winter 2018 Seasonal Event - exclusive to the [[Sky Beta|Beta]] version of the game. As of the Season of Rhythm, which was an expanded version of the Winter 2018 Season, this Gift Pack was retired since all of the pack's contents were to be included as part of the season. Owners of the Winter Musician Pack were thus given the Season Pass for the Season of Rhythm automatically at no extra cost<ref name=":0">https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/601-patch-notes---january-22-2020---0-8-0-145484/</ref>.

The Winter Musician Pack was replaced with a new pack called Gratitude Fur Cape Pack<ref name=":0" /> that was available during the Season of Rhythm. As with the Winter Pack, the Gratitude Pack included Cosmetics and Music Sheets from a previous Season (it contained all items from the [[Saluting Protector]] – Season of Gratitude). Since Traveling Spirits were only just being introduced at the time this Pack was being sold, Saluting Protector did not make its first appearance as a Traveling Spirit until 2 years later.
