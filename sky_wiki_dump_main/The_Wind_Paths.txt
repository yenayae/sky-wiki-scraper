<section begin="Summary" />'''The Wind Paths''' is a seasonal area added to [[Hidden Forest]], introduced along with the [[Season of Flight]] in [[Version History#0.15.0|Patch 0.15.0]]. All the quests, spirits, and activities can be found in this area. The entrance to The Wind Paths is through a pathway in the clouds, up and to the right of Hidden Forest Social Space with a Spirit Gate requiring one Regular Spirit from [[Vault]] to have been relived. The Wind Paths serves as a connection to multiple areas of Sky, as well as reconnecting with Light Creatures.<section end="Summary" />

==Overview==
{{Quote|<br>'''''Chimes guide creatures to clear passage through the realms.'''''|Restored Wind Paths Opening}}


<section begin="Overview" />The Wind Paths is a spacious area abundant with clouds. The [[Flight Guide]] stands on the main island in the center. Surrounding the Guide are 4 Seasonal Spirits, which upon reliving, will give players their unique [[Expressions]]. Additionally, there is a [https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Map_Shrines?file=Flight-area-map-shrine.jpg#Daylight_Prairie Map Shrine] to be found on the higher island to the left of the main island.

The Wind Paths has two sections: the floating islands and the cloud tunnel. Initially, only the floating islands are accessible to the player. Completing the quest given by the [[Flight Guide]] will unlock the three sections of the cloud tunnel. It will give players direct access to cloud tunnels that lead to [[Cave of Prophecies]], [[Sanctuary Islands]], [[Underground Caverns]], [[Hermit Valley]], [[Forgotten Ark]], and [[Starlight Desert]]. Players can also unlock one more cloud tunnel located behind the main island leading to [[Aviary Village]] upon the completion of the [[Season of Revival#Quest #9|ninth seasonal Quest]] from [[Season of Revival]].<section end="Overview" />
