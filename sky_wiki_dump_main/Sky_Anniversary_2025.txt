{{#ev:youtube|4HglWHSuZn0||right|6th Anniversary Trailer}}
It’s time for Sky’s 6th birthday, and this year’s celebration is so big it won’t fit in just the [[Update:Live 0.29.5 (325756 Android, Huawei, iOS, PlayStation, Steam, Switch)|0.29.5]] update! The first part of this six-week long event began on '''Monday, July 7, 2025, at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and continued until '''Sunday, August 17, 2025, at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''42''' days. For the duration of the event, the Anniversary Guide stood at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to teleport players to the anniversary version of the Aviary.

A new passageway in the Aviary Village leads to an abandoned cinema. Help to restore it during the first part of the event, and find some delightful surprises along the way.

The Anniversary party featured weekly quests that granted weekly [[Currency#Event Tickets|event currency]]. In other words, complete the weekly quest once it’s released, and it would reward a week’s batch of Event Tickets, instead of getting several per day for multiple days in a row. There’s more than cinema quests, of course—explore [[Aviary Village]] for new activities and returning favorites. Not to mention, the [[Secret Area]] accessible from the [[Vault of Knowledge]] was open to everyone too!

Birthday hats for each year up to last year and the [[Sky Anniversary/2024#SkyFest 5th Anniversary T-shirt|SkyFest 5th Anniversary T-shirt]] are exclusive to the year they celebrate, but other birthday items from past years were back! Items introduced for Event Tickets last year could be unlocked this year with [[Currency|in-game currency]] such as Candles, Hearts, and Ascended Candles. Free trial [[Spells]] were available for all items (with the exception of the TGC Wireframe Cape).

===Sky Cinema===
{{Quote|For those who aspire to share their light and lift our hearts with their stories.}}
The Sky Cinema is a reimagined version of the SkyFest Cinema, which was originally accessible through the Eye of Eden gate, and hosted the Developer Talk stage during SkyFest. Now, the entrance to the Developer Talk stage can be found to the left of the [[Aviary Village#Aviary Village Archway Café Counter|Aviary Village Archway Café Counter]]. To gain access, players must {{Icon|Icon flame.png}} light the three lanterns in front of the entrance to activate the mechanism, before using the {{Emote|Levitating Adept|inline_text}} Expression to clear the rocks blocking the entryway.

During the second week of the event, players could restore the Sky Cinema by lighting the movie posters and using {{Emote|Pouty Porter|inline_text}} to reactivate the archways' lights. The six posters are inspired by iconic real-world films: My Neighbor Totoro, The Lion King, Jaws, Star Wars, Forrest Gump, and Jurassic Park. The restored Cinema features an [[Cosmetics#Outfit_Shrines|Outfit Shrine]] where players can change their cosmetics.

In the room leading to the outdoor Cinema, two Guide Spirits stood, offering [[Premium Candle Shop|IAP]] and in-game currency items, respectively. Additionally, the nearby popcorn machine offers a [[Sky Anniversary#Anniversary Cinema Set|Cinema Popcorn Bucket]] Spell for {{Cost|2 C}}, limited to two Spells per day.<br>

====Oreo's Playground====
Oreo’s Playground takes place in a version of [[Aviary Village]] filled with playful [[Oreo]] dogs during the occasion. Players could collect scattered [[Pieces of Light]] from small Oreos on the ground, [[Friendship Menu#Chat|Chat]] atop a large Oreo’s head, soar through the sky on flying Oreos, and be launched into the air by the joyful bark of a giant Oreo’s face.<br>

====Ball Game====
Based on a mini-game from the [[AURORA Encore Concerts]] – The Great Spheres, the Ball Game has been reimagined for players to enjoy in the [[Aviary]], tucked behind the broken Bell Tower. As players score goals, [[Pieces of Light]] become collectible within the giant goal structures.<br>
<br>
{{#ev:youtube|Ai2kH20Zdow|300|left|Ball Game Video Walkthrough}}
<!--<gallery widths="175" spacing="small" captionalign="center"></gallery>-->
{{Clear}}
====Art of Sky Gallery====
The Art of Sky Gallery transports players to a wireframe version of the [[Hidden Forest]]; a raw, untextured space that reveals the realm in its early design stages. There, players could explore concept art from across the kingdom and experience the evolving emotional tone of the game’s world. Pieces of light could be collected with every lantern lit.
<!--<gallery widths="175" spacing="small" captionalign="center"></gallery>-->
{{Clear}}
====Micro Mode====
In Micro Mode, Skykids were reduced to a tiny size, making the world around them feel enormous.  Players could collect scattered mini gift bags on the ground for extra light, turning exploration into a toy-like adventure. Tiny mode was also active in the shops.  
<!--<gallery widths="175" spacing="small" captionalign="center"></gallery>-->
====Sky Tower====
Sky Tower is a chaotic climbing game where players scale an unstable mountain made of randomly stacked floating props and game components, while being capeless. The goal is to jump from one item to the other and maintain balance to reach the top without falling. Players could gather pieces of light falling from the top of the Tower.<br>

====Pool Party====
The Pool Party floods part of [[Aviary Village]], turning it into a large pool park. Players could collect light from a giant eel and clams scattered across the seabed. Entrances and the areas near the Constellation Table and Anniversary Guide are protected by a bubble where players can move as usual. The Pool Party area features a large floating tube, a few floating props that can be used, {{Days Item|Sunlight Surfboard|icon|label=Surfboards|inline_text}}, and beach balls for a fun game with friends.<br>
<br>

====TGC Office====
The Office was open to everyone as part of the celebrations to rediscover last year’s events, featuring hourly birthday sing‑alongs and dance parties on the rooftop, along with special Spirit performances such as Skidmore’s solos and ensemble encores, creature‑summoning rituals, parkour showcases, cosplay segments, and more. 
<!--<gallery widths="175" spacing="small" captionalign="center"></gallery>-->
{{Clear}}
====History of Sky Gallery====
The History of Sky Gallery takes players to a wireframe version of the Isle of Dawn, showcasing the realm in its earliest design phase. Within this untextured space, players can explore the origins of TGC, discover behind-the-scenes insights, celebrate the team’s achievements, and learn about the game's recognitions earned along the journey. Pieces of light were gathered with each lantern lit.

===2025 New Cosmetics and Props===
====TGC Wireframe Cape====
::'''''"Commemorating magical moments in the world of Sky thanks to you. Allows revisiting the festive transformation of Aviary Village, History of Sky gallery, Art of Sky gallery, and Developer Talk stage."'''''
<section begin="TGC Wireframe Cape" />The TGC Wireframe Cape allows the owner and anyone they're holding hands with to permanently access the Sky Anniversary version of [[Aviary Village]], though not the [[Secret Area]] and Cinema programming. While there are no visual changes to the [[Sky Anniversary/2024#SkyFest Wireframe Cape|SkyFest Wireframe Cape]] itself—aside from the absence of the scarf, new events tied to the Sky Anniversary will be added over time, increasing the Cape's value and appeal. Players who purchased the 2024 Cape will automatically gain access to all 2025 activities and scheduled content associated with it (and so forth), making it a lasting and evolving cosmetic tied to ongoing celebrations. The option to revisit the Anniversary festivities is enabled in the [[Expression Menu]]; simply open the [[Menus_and_Controls#Emote_Submenu|Emote Submenu]] with the item equipped and select the {{Days Item|TGC Wireframe Cape|icon}} Cape's icon to be teleported to the area.  The History of Sky and Art of Sky galleries available from the Isle of Dawn and Hidden Forest portals will be available 24/7 when using the Cape. 

This [[Cape]] was introduced in 2025 and is available for {{Cost|19.99 USD|refnote}}  from the Spirit in the corridor at the [[Secret Area|Office]]. Unlike the SkyFest Wireframe Cape, which was only available in 2024, '''this item remained available after Sky Anniversary ended.'''<ref>"TGC Wireframe Cape: [...] Scheduled to remain available after Sky Anniversary ends." - {{v|0.29.5}} Patch Notes</ref><br>

====Anniversary Cinema Set====
::'''''"Every moment feels blockbuster-worthy with these retro red- and blue-tinted 3D glasses and popcorn bucket."'''''
The Anniversary Cinema Set contains two items: the Cinema 3D Glasses and the Cinema Popcorn Bucket. The Cinema 3D Glasses are a [[Face Accessory]]—a pair of white vintage 3D glasses with one red lens and one blue lens, resembling the early models used in classic film and entertainment.  

The Cinema Popcorn Bucket [[Prop]] is a classic rectangle popcorn bag filled with popcorn. The sides have vertical blue and white stripes that continue to the inside. The front and back are a plain blue with a white four-pointed star in the middle. When equipped, the player holds it in front of them, and when used, the player brings a handful of popcorn to their face in a playful eating animation. It cannot be placed and therefore cannot be used in [[Shared Spaces]]. 

This set was introduced in 2025 and was available for {{Cost|4.99 USD|refnote}} from the [[Premium Candle Shop]] for the duration of the event.<br>
