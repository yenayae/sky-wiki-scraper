'''Days of Style''' is an annual event celebrating self-expression and creativity through fashion that usually happens around the beginning of October and lasts until the middle of the month. It was first introduced in 2023, following after [[Days of Sunlight]].

During the two-week event, fashion runways appear in different locations throughout the [[Realms]], bringing with them a special [[Cosmetics#Outfit Shrines|Closet Shrine]] that offers a rotating selection of cosmetics for players to temporarily borrow. Each of these runways offer a unique theme, and players are invited to create an ensemble interpreting that theme in whichever way they choose. A nearby [[Shared Memories Candles|Shared Memory Shrine]] can be used to show off your creativity and best runway walk for other Sky Kids to enjoy. So, grab your [[Cape]], perfect your pose, and get ready to shine!

Fashion-themed [[IAP]]s are available from the in-game shop, and the Style Guide Spirit offers various cosmetics from their Friendship Tree. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the Style Gift Box at [[Home]] or the [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Spell Shop]] in Aviary Village.

{{#ev:youtube|3wYryzXM6EQ||right|Days of Style 2024 Trailer}}
Days of Style returned for a second year, bringing even more flair, fun, and opportunities to shine! The event began on '''September 30, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and continued until '''October 13, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Style Guide appeared in [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to a fashion runway located in one of the [[Realms]]. Their locations rotated regularly, and this year included four new locations too!

''Note: If the event area for the day was in a Realm that the player had never been to before, it was not possible to teleport from the meditation circle to the event area.''

Design outfits that truly capture the essence of each theme—whether bold, whimsical, chaotic, or elegant—and don’t worry about missing the perfect accessory! Temporary closets will be nearby, packed with items to borrow so that you can create the ultimate look. Once your avatar is ready, use the runway's [[Shared Memories Candles|Shared Memory Shrine]] to strut your stuff and share your personalized interpretation with the entire ''Sky'' community (and earn some [[Pieces of Light|Light]] in the process). Whether you're going for dashing or dazzling, this event has everything you need to make your mark on the runway. So, grab your cape, perfect your pose, and get ready to shine.

For this year’s event, TGC revamped how players earned [[Currency#Event Currency|Event Currency]] (also known as Tickets). Instead of picking up themed tokens, Event Currency was earned incrementally, similar to how currency like regular [[Currency#Candles|Candles]] and [[Currency#Season Candles|Seasonal Candles]] are typically gathered. Event Currency appeared as large, shining blue orbs of Light, scattered around the stage. As players gathered this dazzling Light, the Event Currency meter filled up. Once it was complete, players could forge a unit of Event Currency to unlock some truly [[Days of Style#2024 New Cosmetics and Props|special items]] that might just fuel their next creative ensemble!

==October 2023<span id="2023"></span>==
[[File:Days-of-Style-promo-image-2023.png|thumb|250px|right|Promotional Image - Days of Style 2023]]
A brand-new event celebrating creativity made its debut! Days of Style began on '''October 2, 2023 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended on '''October 15, 2023 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Style Guide appeared in [[Home]], offering to take players directly to a fashion runway placed in one of the [[Realms]].

Show off your best runway walk and have a bit of fun trying out (and trying on!) something new - closets near each runway would temporarily lend you clothes and other cosmetics. Players were invited to create an ensemble to represent a unique theme and use a [[Shared Memories Candles|Shared Memory Shrine]] to share that interpretation with other players (and earn a bit of [[Pieces of Light|Light]] at the end of your performance). 

{{#ev:youtube|2nnOFJVvxAw||inline|Days of Style 2023 Trailer}}

During the event, fashion-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] were available from the in-game shop and the Style Guide offered various cosmetics from their Friendship Tree. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items could also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy Traveler's Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]].
