==Memory==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|LU0TuA35_l4||inline|Video Guide}}

The Lively Navigator can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on the higher of two of floating islands to the left of the largest main island when coming from the area's main entrance. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Lively Navigator can be seen boarding a flying boat pulled by a single [[Mantas|Manta]]. They arrive shortly afterwards at the main island and dock the boat to begin walking, following a path that winds around to the other side. The Lively Navigator then grabs a pair of hand-held flags that are laying nearby and begins to work, using marshaling signals with the flags to direct the flow of traffic in the Wind Paths. Sometime later, a flying boat carrying the [[Talented Builder]] arrives, with a large flock of Mantas headed directly towards them. Alarmed by the potential collision, the Lively Navigator scrambles to direct the other Spirit out of danger.

At the end of the memory, the Talented Builder waves with gratitude towards the Lively Navigator from the boat as they continue on their way without incident. Pleased by the job well done, the Lively Navigator nods back in affirmation.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar raise both arms straight ahead at chest level, palms facing inwards, before stretching their right arm straight up as a cymbal and chime sound effect plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with trails of small golden sparkles following your avatar's hands as they raise them, and a glowing, green, vertical light periodically shooting up from the hand pointing towards the sky, beginning when they've stopped moving, and a trail of sparkles like in the beginning of the Expression following your avatar's raised hand as it is dropped down again when the avatar has been moved.
*Level 3 will make your avatar take a big step forward on one foot and raise both arms straight ahead at chest level, palms touching, before then straightening to wave both hands together in a wide circle, before pointing them straight up, torso facing the side as they raise a bent leg, periodically glancing up and to the side, as a drum and more elaborate chime sound effect plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Upon doing so, your avatar will drop their arms and turn back to the front with a little hop.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with trails of small, golden sparkles following your avatar's hands as they move, and as they exit the Expression, it will have small, gray dust clouds following the foot that is being dragged in the middle of the Expression.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
