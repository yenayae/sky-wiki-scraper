== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|bBjri4XwR2c||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Confetti Cousin can be found in [[Butterfly Fields]] on top of the round, hollow dome containing the [[Butterfly Charmer]]. This Spirit has a [[Collection Memory|collection memory]] with 9 memory fragments and an 8-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Confetti Cousin can be seen playfully exploring the grassy hills of the Butterfly Fields, stopping frequently to admire blooming flowers.

At the end of the memory, the carefree Confetti Cousin launches colorful scraps of confetti into the air several times, using a small popper. The player steps closer, grabs a bell from underneath their cape and rings it, causing the Confetti Cousin to stop. They bring their hand to their chin and think for a short while, before they raise up their arm in epiphany, with a glowing exclamation mark blinking above their head.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar raise their hands to shoulder level, before performing a pulling gesture as if popping a confetti popper, launching yellow confetti into the air, which turns pink as it falls down, while a popping sound and bell jingling sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, but with yellow confetti that turns into different shades of pink and blue, while popping, bell jingling, and quiet firework sound effects play.
*Level 3 makes the same motion as Level 1, but with green confetti that turns into different shades of orange and red, while popping, bell jingling, and firework launch sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 1, but with yellow confetti that turns red and white, while popping, bell jingling, and firework explosion sound effects play.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
