== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|CuQdKjxaNN4||inline|Video Guide}}

The Scarecrow Farmer can be found directly behind the [[Forgotten Ark]], near a small patch of barren farmland where the [[Season of Enchantment#Quest #1|red light]] is found. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 5-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
As their memory unfolds, the Scarecrow Farmer can be seen pouring water over a patch of farmland, appearing to plant seeds in the ground before heading back to the pool to refill their water jar. They take the jar back to their little farm, only to realize that birds have started to gather around the seeds. Immediately the Scarecrow Farmer hurries to their seeds and shoos the birds away.

At the end of the memory, the Scarecrow Farmer walks by their patch of farmland, only to spot that a flock of birds has gathered around their planted seeds. They shake their head before rushing to the birds and scare them away by going in a crouched position and throwing up their arms.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar rapidly hop forward in a crouched standing position with their back hunched, throw up their arms, and wiggle them around in circles, while a jaw harp sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with red clouds of fire bursting from your avatar's hands.
*Level 3 will make your avatar take a big leap forward, straddling their legs and arms wildly in the air, before landing and only continuing the motion with their arms as seen in Level 1, while more muted jaw harp and drum sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with small purple clouds appearing around your avatar as they leap in the air, followed by a big exclamation mark flickering under them before they land, and vertical purple beams of light appearing in front of them and spreading outwards as they land on the ground.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
