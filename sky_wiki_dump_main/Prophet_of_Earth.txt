== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|fS9lZNwF_jg||inline|Video Guide}}

The Prophet of Earth can be found in the [[Cave of Prophecies]], near the entrance to the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Earth|Trial of Earth]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 8 memory fragments and a 5-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Prophet of Earth can be seen educating a younger pair of Spirits about the history of the Cave. The Prophet of Earth first greets the young Spirits before directing them to a seating area at the center of the Cave of Prophecies. Together, they sit with a larger group of Spirits listening intently to the lessons being provided by all four of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#All_Prophecy_Friendship_Trees|Prophets]]. The group then splits up as the Prophet of Earth takes their students aside, leading them towards the entrance of the [[Season_of_Prophecy#The_Trial_of_Earth|Trial of Earth]] to continue the lesson. All three Spirits stretch their muscles before starting to climb the steep terrain - only for the clumsiest student to slip and nearly fall before the others could catch them.

At the end of the memory, the Prophet of Earth teaches the younger Spirits about resilience by decisively brushing a hand over both shoulders.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar brush their hand twice over the left shoulder and once over the right, while tambourine sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with small dust clouds appearing from the brushing motions.
*Level 3 will make your avatar raise both their arms up in front of them and brush off the right one, then the left, as well as their lap, before tilting their neck from side to side as if to crack it, and hop up once, while more elaborate tambourine sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a shower of white light particles falling as your avatar brushes off their arms, and large dark dust clouds forming around their body as they brush off their lap.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

==Trivia==
* Each [[Season_of_Prophecy#All_Prophecy_Friendship_Trees|Prophet]] is inspired by an animal, and represented by an element of nature. The Prophet of Earth is inspired by a spider, with a tarantula mask and webbed cape. The "Dust Off" Expression may also be based on how spiders brush their legs to clean the bristly hairs that help them gip and climb.
