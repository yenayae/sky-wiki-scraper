The '''Season of Enchantment''' began Monday, April 20, 2020 and ended on the Sunday, June 21, 2020, lasting 62 days. It was the fifth Seasonal event in Sky since the game’s global release, and the first Season available following Sky’s launch for Android.

This first-of-its-kind Season introduced a more interactive and narrative-based format for Seasonal events as well as a new area to explore in [[Golden Wasteland]] called [[Forgotten Ark]]. It was here where all the Season’s Spirits could be found, and where the Season’s magical story slowly unfolded.

Enchantment followed the [[Season of Rhythm]] and preceded the [[Season of Sanctuary]].

==Welcome==

{{Quote|<br>A group of Spirits started their voyage towards prosperity. Take the boat and set sail. Follow their path, a new land awaits…|Season of Enchantment opening}}

Our newest Season follows the story of a group of mysterious Spirits helpless in a desolate land, who have crashed in Golden Wasteland and need your help. Which Spirit will you befriend first?

A boat arrives at the pier in Golden Wasteland. Players are invited to climb aboard and sail to a new area called Forgotten Ark. After docking, players pass over the top of a hill and gaze down upon a vast and desolate landscape, a crashed ark rests in the center of the area. It seems the Spirits who had set out on a voyage did not quite make it; we must help them. One by one, players befriend each Spirit and live their memories.

==Forgotten Ark==
[[File:Forgotten Ark.jpg|thumb|300px]]{{Quote|<br>'''''What was covered in the sand?'''''|Forgotten Ark opening}}
A new area called 'Forgotten Ark' was added in Golden Wasteland during the Season of Enchantment in April 2020. When you enter the first area, after you've plunged to the ground, explore the right-hand side of the map--the opposite side from where the Faint Spirit resides. There you will find a pier and a boat. Sit and meditate on the boat, and it will take you to the new area.

For more information, please look at the [[Forgotten Ark]] page.

Besides the Ark, which is the first thing you see in this new area, there is a maze-like cave structure off to the right, and another cave structure straight ahead beyond the Ark. Both are filled with [[Dark Crabs]]. Other smaller artefacts can also be found. Previously, the player could also collect candles from four hidden mushrooms, though these were removed in the 0.9.2 patch.

The Season introduced a new format for finding the Spirits and for Quests. 

*At [[Home]] players could find the normal Daily Quest-Giver with the same Daily Quests that have been a part of every Season so far.
*In Forgotten Ark there was another appearance of the Quest Master, called the Guide (in this case, the Enchantment Guide) with a wholly different type of Quests. While all of the Seasonal Spirits were located in the Forgotten Ark area, the Quests was sending players off to different Realms to find all Colored Lights. The Enchantment story was unfolding as the weeks went by.

==Daily Quests & Seasonal Candles==
The Adventure Pass was available as a pre-order, and included 10 additional Seasonal Candles for the Pass owners.

===Seasonal Bunches Locations===
[[File:Enchantment candles.JPG|thumb|140x140px|Seasonal Candle bunch]]Each day the Quest-Giver stands next to a Realm's Portal, indicating where the day's Seasonal Candle bunches are found. The chosen Realm will contain four sets/bunches of Seasonal Candles which together perfectly add up to one whole Seasonal Candle. Unlike previous Seasons, the Colored Lights decide the locations rather than the Spirits (as they are all found in the Forgotten Ark). 

*[[Daylight Prairie]]: Bird Nest (the right Spirit Gate from Butterfly Fields)
*[[Hidden Forest]]: The Boneyard (last big area, with jellyfish)
*[[Valley of Triumph]]: The Ice Rink
*[[Golden Wasteland]]: The new Seasonal Area, Forgotten Ark. The Candles are scattered on the Ark itself
*[[Vault of Knowledge]]: 2-player area on the first floor

==Child of Light Locations<span id="Winged Light Locations"></span>==
Two new Winged Light can be found in Forgotten Ark. One is easily found on the bow of the Ark. The other is inside a cave structure beyond it.

==Spirit Memory Quests==
Find-the-light new Quests format were made available across the Season's duration. Retrieving these Colored Lights for the Quest-Giver Spirit at the Forgotten Ark unlocks a special cutscene for each Light returned. Each returned Light will be used to magically enhance or revitalize the area in some way; the background music also changes alongside. This is all part of an unfolding story of transformation throughout the Season. The Find-the-light quests are still available today to complete. 

After completing all quests, the ark is fully restored. Three permanent [[Blessings (Spells)|Blessing]] shops are added to the ark: a [[Scroll Shop]], a [[Potion Shop]], and a [[Spell Shop]].  In addition, five clusters of [[Pieces_of_Light#Forgotten_Ark|candles]] are added.

===Quest #1<span id="Quest 1"></span>===
{{quote|This Spirit longs for '''Red Light'''. They can be found where darkness prevails.}}
The same quest can also be a Golden Wasteland [[Quests|daily quest]] where it is called "Collect Red Light".

Red Light can be collected in either of two possible locations. The two locations are equivalent, both for completing the Enchantment Guide's quest and for completing the daily quest. 
*On the [[Forgotten Ark]] map, at the far end of the map. It is found near a pool of polluted water, adjacent to the Scarecrow Farmer's fields and in front of a cave containing a Child of Light.
*On the [[Crab Fields]] map, circulating around and through the shipwreck. The light can easily be caught by standing inside the ship.

To complete the Enchantment Guide's quest, you must return to the Guide. You are told that "You've fulfilled a wish of this Ancestor Spirit". A cutscene shows you giving the Red Light to the Nodding Muralist who uses the light to illuminate the murals painted on the ark. The murals remain permanently visible after the quest is done.

=== Quest #2<span id="Quest 2"></span>===

Players are told that the Spirits now seek '''Blue Light''', and that "rumours point toward the pure waters of a mountain lake". Upon returning the Light, the Indifferent Alchemist uses it to purify the sky and the pond water, turning both blue, also summoning the same koi fish we have seen in the little pond at [[Home]] and the pool outside the temple in [[Daylight Prairie]]. 

''You can find the blue light in the Valley of Triumph [[Ice Rink]]. It goes under the ice, so it may be hidden from immediate view.''

===Quest #3<span id="Quest 3"></span>===
Players are told that the Spirits now yearn for '''Cyan Light''', and that it "lingers among the early gusts of wind". Upon returning the Light, the Crab Walk Spirit uses it to create an updraft which forms holes in the clouds above, allowing sunlight to pour through. It also raises half of the Ark's oars out of the sand, causing them to turn and row gently in the wind.

''You can find the Cyan light above the clouds in the area of Isle of Dawn just before the exit to Daylight Prairie. The quickest way to find it is by going to Daylight Prairie, and then going backwards into the Isle of Dawn.''

===Quest #4<span id="Quest 4"></span>===
Players are told that the Spirits now need '''Green Light''', and that "the fable is they are gifts to the earth from the sky". Upon returning the Light, the Scarecrow Farmer uses it to fertilize the land around the pond, causing patches of vibrant flowers and grass to bloom out of the gray sand.

''You can find the Green light in the [[Bird Nest]] area of [[Daylight Prairie]]. When you first enter the area, the Green Light will be high above you, carried by the group of Mantas. Eventually it will drop down toward one of the islands, where it will land.''

===Quest #5<span id="Quest 5"></span>===
Players are told that the Spirits now pray for '''Purple Light''', and that "it is said they hoard ancient secrets". Upon returning the Light, the Doze (Snoozing Carpenter)  Spirit uses it to decorate the Ark in colorful tassel-adorned tents, draped tapestries, hanging lamps and drifting bunting lines. Day turns into night; a crescent moon now glistens through one of the holes in the clouds, drenching the area in an enchanting moonlit glow.

''You can find the Purple light in Vault of Knowledge inside the Archives: the new area added with Season of Belonging that is beyond the [[Vault of Knowledge#2-player Area|two-person door on the bottom floor]].''

===Quest #6<span id="Quest 6"></span>===
Players are told that the Spirits now cry for '''Orange Light''', and that "they offer warmth in times of cold". After returning the Light, the Play Fight Spirit sends it blazing through the area, calling together all the Spirits of the Forgotten Ark. The gathered Spirits all look upon you the player, each nodding in farewell and gratitude for your help. They then collectively ascend to the sky and depart. Left behind is the cargo of their voyage, their tools, wisdom, and treasures, that which we can use to forge our own spells. The lamps are lit; birds and butterflies now inhabit the once gloomy wreckage. Thanks to you, the ark no longer sits lost in darkness but is now filled with light and life.

''You can find the Orange light in the [[Boneyard]] area of [[Hidden Forest]], before you enter the Temple. It is not directly in the Broken Bridge area, but in the area just before that, near the tree house that has a constellation gate around it. The tree house is to the left. There is fungi around the area. At first this Light, too, is high above, but eventually comes down so that it is easier to catch. It is not recommended to catch it when it's high above, since you might be reset to the beginning of this area as you fly too high. If you don't have much wing energy, waiting for it to come down is recommended. You may also want to rest on the fungi while you wait. The solution is to stop the rain first by lighting the structure on the water and the orange light will descend slowly.''
