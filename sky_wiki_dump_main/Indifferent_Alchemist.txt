== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|XpMexGi-YO4||inline|Video Guide}}

The Indifferent Alchemist can be found far past the [[Forgotten Ark]], on the hills behind the polluted pond where the [[Red Light]] is collected. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 12-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Indifferent Alchemist can be seen climbing over the hill and crawling to a cave entrance below. They sprint through the cave until they reach to what seemed like a dead end in the cave. 

At the end of the memory, the Alchemist procures a blue light and tosses it into the air. The blue light circles around the room until it settles down on the sand in the center. The Alchemist then shrugs as the blue light doesn't seem to do anything else.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar hold their hands up and to the side in a shrug pose, shaking their head in confusion, while a saxophone like sound effect plays.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with trails of white sparkles following the avatar's hands, as well as a big glowing question mark appearing over the avatar's head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar raise their arms, palms facing up, and turn from one side to another, their confusion being emphasized with notes of an oboe, before facing forward, still shrugging, while a whistle flute sound effect plays.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with trails of white sparkles following the avatar's hands, and a big, glowing, flickering exclamation mark appearing over the avatar's head with each turn, as well as a big glowing question mark on the final shrug.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
