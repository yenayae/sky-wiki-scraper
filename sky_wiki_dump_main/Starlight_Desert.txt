==Overview==
The Starlight Desert is a vast expanse of shimmering sand dune bathed in a perpetual twilight, where the stars above cast a gentle glow upon the landscape. All around the area will be familiar scenes from the titular story of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's [[wp:The Little Prince|The Little Prince]] (French: ''Le Petit Prince''); a subjectless king, a narcissist actor, a shameful drunkard, a greedy businessman, a burdened lamplighter, and a speculating geographer. Explore and discover the various ironies and beauties of the Starlight Desert.

In the center of the dunes stands [[The Rose]] - acting as The Little Prince Guide. All around the Rose is 6 Seasonal Spirits, modeled after the characters above, to relive and receive their unique [[Expressions]]. Additionally there is a [[Map Shrine]] in the Garden area. This area holds 2 sub-areas, the Jellyfish Cove and Windy Dunes.

===Child of Light Locations===
Three (3) [[Children of Light]] have been added to the new [[Starlight Desert]] area.<br>

==Giant Jar==
[[File:Giant-Jar-Interior-Little-Prince.png|thumb|right|300px|Interior of the Giant Jar]]
The Giant Jar is a big, overturned jar, located near the entrance to the Starlight Desert and the entrance to The Windy Dunes. The inside of the jar is relatively small and is scattered with a multitude of jars and other debris. The [[Slouching Soldier]] also resides inside the jar among the rubble.

==Jellyfish Cove==
[[File:Starlight-Desert-Jellyfish-Cove.png|thumb|right|300px|Jellyfish Cove in the Starlight Desert]]
The Jellyfish Cove is located near the Garden and rose aviary in the Starlight Desert, hidden within the clouds. The cove is a hidden sanctuary with a shipwreck abundant with [[Jellyfish]]. Compared to other areas of the game, the gravity is also much weaker, allowing the player to jump much higher and glide much further. Within the shipwreck is the [[Star Collector]], available to be relived.

==The Land of Tears==
[[File:Vault-Starlight-Desert-Land-of-Tears.png|thumb|right|300px|The Land of Tears]]
The Land of Tears is located towards the Eden Mountain in the Starlight Desert. Fly above the clouds and land on the dunes and keep walking towards the mountain. Do not fly as the winds are extremely strong and will push you back. The transition is only unlocked after opening [[Season of The Little Prince#Quest #6|Little Prince Quest #6]].

<section begin="Memorial" />
A monument was added to the Land of Tears area of the Starlight Desert in honor of a late TGC employee in Patch {{v|0.21.0}}, and others in-team to whom TGC has had to say goodbye to. It also serves as a spot for those to place a message for your lost beloved ones. While in the area, the OST "[[Original Sound Track#Volume 3|Attachments]]" from the 3rd Sky OST Volume by Vincent Diamante will play in the background. 
::''“In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so, it will be as if all the stars will be laughing when you look at the sky at night.”'' <section end="Memorial" />

==Trivia==
*The tunnel entrance after entering the [[Spirit Gate]] leading to the Starlight Desert shares a striking resemblance to the Pink Desert in [https://journey.fandom.com/wiki/Journey_Wiki Journey], a game also developed by thatgamecompany.
*The entrance to the Starlight Desert previously connected directly to the [[Vault of Knowledge#Social Space|Vault Social Space]], but with Update {{v|0.23.5}}, the entrance was moved into the newly added [[Vault of Knowledge#Collaboration Room|Collaboration Room]]. 
*The Jellyfish Cove was used as the [[Days of Love#February 2024|Days of Love 2024]] event space, adding a new dock and small islets to the area.
*The Starlight Desert is featured in a piece of merch from thatskyshop, in the form of the [[That Sky Shop/Wave 10#Starlight Desert Pin|Starlight Desert Pin]]. It has a STAR feature which allows you and the friends holding your hand to teleport to the Rose Garden in the Starlight Desert.
