==Welcome==
<center class="title-text-welcome">[https://www.thatskygame.com/news/teaser-season-of-prophecy Welcome to the Season of Prophecy!]</center>{{Quote|<br/>'''''Beware the prophecy...'''''}}
The Season of Prophecy will take adventurers on an origin story to expand the lore behind the kingdom of Sky. Venture forth into the eerie new Cave of Prophecies in [[Isle of Dawn]] to begin your adventure—a stark contrast to the relaxing, sunny experience that was the [[Season of Sanctuary]]. Straying from the traditional six spirits that appear during a Season, the Season of Prophecy focuses on four Prophets/Spirits—who will present challenges the likes of which Sky Children have never seen before. Team up with fellow adventurers, newcomers and veterans alike, to face these trials in creative ways, and celebrate the challenges you've overcome together.

A number of changes have been introduced with this season:

*There are only four Spirits to meet, rather than six, and to enter, one must go through a portal.
*Similar to the previous two seasons, all Spirits will be found in the new Cave of Prophecies area located in Isle of Dawn.
*Cosmetic prices have increased to account for fewer Spirits to buy them from. Prices no longer follow previous patterns.
*Trials have been added, which will act like mini-games.

==Cave of Prophecies==
{{Main|Cave of Prophecies}}

{{Quote|<br/>'''''Beware the ancient trials'''''|Cave of Prophecies Opening}}
A new area has been added to [[Isle of Dawn]] introduced along with the Season of Prophecy in Patch 0.11.0, called the [[Cave of Prophecies]]. Just like the previous season, all the quests, spirits and activities can be found in this area. To enter the Cave of Prophecies, head to the top right edge of [[Isle of Dawn]], where an opening in the clouds will begin your adventure. To enter the Cave, you must have 2 spirits from the [[Hidden Forest]]. The Cave of Prophecies will guide you on a journey to unravel Sky's long forgotten past. 

Upon entering, you will be met with narrow passageway, in which you will have to traverse through and see the ancient murals of the magical powers. Going through the passage will lead you to the main part of the Cave, where you will first see the Prophecy Guide. In the areas surrounding the Guide, there will be 4 Prophets/Spirits, which upon completing, will give you their unique Expression. 

The Prophecy Guide will embark you on four quests periodically - four trials tied to each respective Prophet/Spirit. Each trial will have its own challenge, each depending on its element; Water, Earth, Air and Fire. Completing each one will slowly decorate the main cave, surrounding you with colorful murals which tell the story of Sky.

==The Trials==
A new feature in the Season of Prophecy is a series of Trials, which will test your skills in the game - without any items, spells, or even your own cape! The completion of one of these trials will unlock a special cutscene depending on the trial you just faced, as well as decorating the Caves with murals. A feature from the trial you've completed will also appear in the Caves (e.g; completing the Trial of Water filled the moat surrounding the island on which the Prophecy Guide stands with water.) Each trial grants you one Winged Light 
===The Trial of Water===
The Trial of Water will test your patience, as you are tasked with reaching the glowing mountain at the end of the map. However, a challenge appears as you have to reach it while avoiding the rising waters, otherwise you'll lose your light and start over from your latest checkpoint. In order to escape the rising waters, you will have to light up lanterns on the ground which will elevate the land and protect you, or find high pieces of land. Completing this Trial will award you with the ''Wisdom of Patience'' and one Winged Light. This Trial summons waterfalls in the Water Prophet's corner, raises a moat of water around the Prophecy Guide, and creates murals scattered across the walls. This Trial came out on October 5.

=== The Trial of Earth===
The Trial of Earth will test your resilience. You are tasked with reaching the shining tower in the middle of the map. To do so, you will have to navigate a maze, which can prove difficult as you will have to jump between rotating rocks to light up lanterns , which will unblock passageways that will allow you to proceed through. Failing to make the jump will lead to you falling to the void, and you will be put back at a checkpoint. At the end of the trial, which takes place in the center of the map, you will be challenged with jumping across a large pit, however, you will only have multiple pieces of rotating rocks to help you, and with the right timing and jumps, will let you to reach the other side and proceed with your journey. Completing this Trial will award you with the ''Wisdom of Resilience'' and one Winged Light''.'' This Trial raises floating islands with chat benches on them, and creates some more murals around the walls. This Trial came out on October 12.

===The Trial of Air ===
The Trial of Air will test your balance. To complete this trial, you are given the task of climbing up a number of floating platforms to reach the top. On some of these platforms, you may find arrows made out of candles, which when lit will cause you to fly in the direction that the arrow points. The player needs to be careful of the wind in the trial, as it may cause your avatar to slide off of the platforms. Completing this trial will grant you the ''Wisdom of Balance'' and one Winged Light. This Trial summons wafts of air that can raise the player which also makes the main cave windy, and summons a mural around the walls. This Trial came out on October 26.

===The Trial of Fire ===
The Trial of Fire will test your courage. To complete this trial, you will have to maneuver through a maze that is shrouded in darkness. However, being in the darkness for too long (5+ seconds) will drain your players light and will make you return to a previous checkpoint. In order to overcome this, you can light the candles found on the floor to not only recharge your avatar, but also form a trail, which you can follow to find the way out. There are 3 floors in total, each offering its own challenge to the player. The player will also discover for the first time the dark worm which can immediately drain all the player's light. Completing this trial will award you the ''Wisdom of Courage'' and one Winged Light. This Trial lights up lamps that can quickly recharge the player's light and creates the final mural painting on roof of the Caves. Standing on the 4 lanterns on the floating islands in a specific order will play bonus cutscenes, adding a golden figure to the murals. This Trial came out on November 9.

==Trivia==
*Not only are they based upon the four elements, but each of the [[#Spirits and Cosmetics|Prophecy Spirits]] resemble animals in both appearance and expression as well;
*#The [[Prophet of Water]] wears cosmetics resembling a sea turtle. Sea turtles take deep breaths when they run out of oxygen.
*#The [[Prophet of Earth]] wears a tarantula mask, and the tips of their cape resemble spider legs. Spiders brush off their legs to clean the little hairs that help them grip and climb.
*#The [[Prophet of Air]] wears a bat mask, and bat wing cape. Bats hang upside-down, and the Balance (Hand-stand) Expression reflects that.
*#The [[Prophet of Fire]] wears a Lion mask. The chest pounding might symbolize a proud lion.
