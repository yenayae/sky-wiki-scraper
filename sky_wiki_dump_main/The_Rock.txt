Beginning at the end of [[Season of Sanctuary]], the developers at TGC started making fun in making a story based on a rock living in the Realms of Sky. While no one was able to find that rock, each patch note ending a new Season features the rock venturing new horizon.  

== The Rock in the game ==
Since update 0.25.0 (April 10, 2024) with Season of Nesting, The Rock has become part of the game. It spawns as inconspicuous greyish-brown cuboid the size of a sky kid's pair of shoes in a random location in Aviary Village every day. It can be picked up only once per day, giving 7 pieces of light, and doesn't respawn after that. Players need to have finished the 3rd quest of Season of Revival to be able to see The Rock.

Currently, for players who set Aviary Village as their spawn point, The Rock will appear at the same place every day - above the windows of Harmony Hall across from the café, giving 5 wax only upon picking up. If not picked up, leaving and reentering Aviary Village will make it spawn at the correct location.

== History of The Rock in the patch notes ==

=== October 2, 2020 ===
A rock from [[Isle of Dawn]] has gone on vacation to [[Sanctuary Islands]] and decided to move there permanently in order to fulfill its lifelong dream of observing [[jellyfish]] in their natural habitat

=== December 15, 2020 ===
The rock made a quick visit to their original land, and found a [[Cave of Prophecies|cave filled with ancient memories]]. They decided to climb to the top for a better view, and saw a heart that had been left for friends to find. Happy to see such kindness, the rock departed for its home. After returning to Sanctuary, they shared these stories around the campfire and gazed at the stars, wondering...

=== March 16, 2021 ===
While taking a break from [[jellyfish]]-watching, the rock decided to stop by a [[Village of Dreams|small village in the Valley of Triumph]]. They've been inspired by all the Skykids they've seen, and hope that they can teach their jelly friends how to ice skate, too!

=== June 29, 2021 ===
After the crisp air and excitement of the ice skating rink, the rock decided to explore the nearby [[forest]]. While wandering amidst the tall trees, they stumbled upon the remains of what appeared to be an old [[treehouse]]! Sky kids were running around everywhere, honking at each other and creating fun item arrangements to bring joy back to the long-neglected space. The rock found a comfy hammock and decided that maybe it was time to take a short nap...

=== September 28, 2021 ===
While napping in the hammock, the rock had a fanciful dream: They explored under the night sky with a brave child and a fox friend, talked to the stars, and played in a [[Starlight Desert|garden maze]]. Waking up and feeling full of inspiration, it was time to set off on a new adventure! But this time, the rock thought they might take more time to stop and appreciate the sunsets along the way.

=== January 13, 2022 ===
In their travels, the rock discovered a brand [[The Wind Paths|new vista of floating islands]]. It seemed like this area was a haven for [[Light Creatures|Light creatures]], and the rock was happy to watch them dance through the sky. Whoever lived here must have loved the creatures a lot; they even crafted chimes so the wind could sing with the [[birds]] and [[mantas]] as they passed through.

=== April 5, 2022 ===
The rock saw a bunch of kids [[Treasure Reef|diving into the water]]. But rocks can't swim (and might be a little scared of monsters), so instead the wandering stone decided to follow their friend Patch-chan on an adventure! There were so many people, wearing [[capes]] and [[masks]] and other costumes! They brought beautiful artwork, left kind messages, and took lots of pictures. The rock watched it all from Patch-chan's cute new bag, peeking out at all of the amazing sights and sounds.

=== June 28, 2022 ===
The rock heard of a [[Village Theater|new theater]] and decided to visit. Before long, they were helping put on plays with the local [[Sky Children|Sky children]] and watching stories unfold on the stage. So many things were possible. Perhaps the rock could even help organize a [[jellyfish]] opera one day? The jellies have such lovely voices!

=== November 28, 2022 ===
The rock had been spending time with their jellyfish friends over in [[Hidden Forest]], enjoying the soft grass and gentle breeze. But all of the jellies keep singing a lovely melody that the rock had never heard before... [[AURORA Concert|Where did they learn it?]] [[AURORA Guide|Who taught them?]] The rock decided that it's time to set out on another quest, to learn who created such a beautiful song.

=== January 10, 2023 ===
The rock found the source of the beautiful songs their friends had been singing. They wrote a diary entry describing their experience:

::<pre>JELLYFISH! So MANY jellyfish! Ohmystarryelders, this is the best day ever!!! I got to BE a jelly! And bloop around a cave! I became AN ACTUAL JELLYFISH!! And mantas and birds and fish and butterflies?! AND JELLYYYYYYYYYYYYY [...]</pre>

The entry continued on like this for several pages, but we only have so much room in the [[Patch Notes|patch notes]]. 

=== April 13, 2023 ===
After an eventful few months, the rock decided that a peaceful picnic might be exactly what they needed. They found a picturesque spot near [[Forgotten Ark|some ruins]], where children and spirits played in a field of flowers. Friends spent time together eating treats and sipping tea, while the butterflies brought joy to everyone around them. With a happy sigh, the rock decided to stay a while longer before setting out on their next journey.

=== July 13, 2023 ===
Feeling nostalgic, the rock wandered back to Isle of Dawn to sleep under the stars of their original home. Little did they know, the quiet expanse was about to become very popular. One night the rock woke to the sound of countless little feet, fluttering capes, and honking Sky kids. Somehow hundreds, even thousands of Sky kids had arrived to help out a group of young Spirits. At last the crowd began to clear, and the rock was surprised to see [[Tumbling Troublemaker|a Spirit]] who could roll around. They were almost as fast as the rock as they taught others to roll...maybe the rock and the Spirit could have a friendly race?

=== October 12, 2023 ===
The rock noticed some [[Days of Style|new fashion]] trends among the locals. The sunglasses their friend from Sanctuary Island gave them were a favorite, but maybe it was time to try something different?

=== December 11, 2023 ===
Over the years, the rock had watched the curious children restore various parts of the world. Now it seemed as though they were focusing their efforts on bringing life back to a [[Aviary Village|long-neglected village]]. Bright colors, new sounds, and old friends were like a breath of fresh air along the little street. The Sky children could accomplish anything when they worked together.

=== January 11, 2024 ===
When the weather gets cold, there's nothing better than visiting [[Days of Feast|Grandma's]] snow hut and sitting by the fire. Cozied up in their scarf, the traveling rock talked to Grandma about all the new things they'd seen and all the changes the children were bringing to the world. Their hearts were warmed by good company and hope for the new year.

=== April 10, 2024 ===
Taking a stroll through [[Prairie Peaks]], the rock admired the blooms and vibrant life all around. The rock wasn't brave enough to tempt lightning the way the Sky kids were doing, but they still enjoyed watching the children fly from blossom to blossom and play among the lily pads. Hiking through the peaks was a lot of work, though, so they decided to head back to a more populated area to see if they could find a cozy spot to relax after a long day.

=== July 2, 2024 ===
The rock decided to visit the colorful festivities that all the Sky kids were honking about. They couldn't use the [[Days_of_Color#Hair_Tint_Spells|hair tint spells]], but a kind jellyfish friend helped out by pretending to be a pretty hat. They had lots of fun together, racing across rainbows and going super fast! The Sky kids didn't even see the rock zooming through and finishing in first place!

=== October 10, 2024 ===
The rock went wandering one night, enjoying the gentle light from the moon and stars. While sitting under a tree, they noticed Sky kids leaving riddles for each other. Wanting to join in on the fun, the rock made their own:

::''"What's the BEST, most AMAZING, CUTEST creature in the whole wide world? <s>You'd better say jellyfish!</s>"''

::...Rocks aren't very good at riddle games.

=== January 16, 2025 ===
While searching for more jellyfish to befriend, the rock spotted a very curious creature! Was that...a crabbit? After following the crabbit, the rock discovered a giant room full of all kinds of treasures: books, mushrooms, and even a wonderful tea party with friends! The rock felt like a tiny pebble in comparison to the huge space, and spent days wandering, meeting new creatures, and appreciating the magic their new crabbit pal had introduced them to.

=== April 17, 2025 ===
The rock was enjoying a weekend back home, and their jellyfish friends invited them to a huge game of hide ‘n' seek. It kept TRYING to hide in the sands of its favorite beach, but for some reason Sky kids kept digging them up! The rock hadn't realized the Sky kids were playing, too, so it called in reinforcements to help hide! It was a fun game, but as the rock traveled onwards, it thought of places that might be better to hide next time.

=== July 18, 2025 ===
Was someone planning a party? The rock noticed signs of festivity everywhere in the little village where they liked to hang out. Balloons, fireworks, birthday songs, and kids running around everywhere talking about something called a cinema where they could watch pictures move and tell stories! The rock wondered how pictures could move but was really curious about what stories would be told here. Maybe someone would tell birthday stories? Perhaps even stories about other rocks??
