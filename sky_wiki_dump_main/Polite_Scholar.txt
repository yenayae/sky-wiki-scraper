The Polite Scholar can be found at the far left of the floating stone platforms on the [[Third Floor Vault|Third Floor of Vault]], opposite of the gazebo structure. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Polite Scholar traverses the floating platforms towards a gazebo, poised and elegant as they walk. 

At the end of the memory, the Polite Scholar stands in the middle of the gazebo, hands clasped in front of them. A large tree then sprouts up from a neighboring platform, stretching high above the gazebo.<br>
