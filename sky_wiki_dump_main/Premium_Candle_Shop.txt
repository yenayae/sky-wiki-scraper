The '''Premium Candle Shop''' is the name of the in-game store allowing players to obtain '''In App Purchases''' ('''IAP'''s), i.e., to purchase specific game [[collectibles]] using real currencies. Only a small subset of the game's collectibles are obtained from the Premium Candle Shop; instead, most items are obtained using in-game [[Currency]] from [[Spirits]]. This page lists all of the IAPs that have ever been available in the game. All prices are listed in US dollars; regional pricing may vary depending upon local taxes and exchange rates.

Credit to leilia#3103 for the timeline and dates. Reorganization by Ray808080. Pack images are from Morybel#0146 and some Seasonal cosmetics included in those images from Mimi#4117 and Ray808080. 

==Accessing the Shop==
The standard Premium Candle Shop can be accessed in two ways. The same items are available from each of these places.
*Clicking the top right corner of your screen, then clicking on the Gear icon to open the [[Gear Menu]]. The second icon in the Gear Menu is for the shop.
*Clicking on the candle icon in the top left corner of your screen when you do not have any candles to forge.

The standard shop is where [[#Candle Packs|Candle Packs]] and Starter Packs are always available. [[#Seasonal Packs|Seasonal Packs]] are available whenever there is an active [[Seasonal Events|Season]]. During [[Special Events]], some IAP cosmetics also appear in the standard Premium Candle Shop.

For IAP purchases that are available from other locations, details on how to obtain the item are provided with the item descriptions below.

For IAP purchases that go through but aren't automatically added to the player's inventory/[[Outfit Shrine]], open the Shop and the item should be available to claim for "Free". Contact [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/contact-us Player Support] for any issues regarding Shop and Purchase Issues.


==Sky Web Store==
[[File:Sky-Web-Store-Home-Page.png|thumb|Sky Web Store Homepage]]
The Sky Web Store is an alternative online web payment method allowing players to purchase in-game store items (IAPs) through Xsolla Pay. It can be accessed through this link: https://webshop.thatskygame.com/ <br>

Players can buy Candles, Seasonal Candles, and Gift Passes for the game to use on any device, except for Nintendo Switch on the Web Store. This does not affect special event items and other in-app purchases, which remain accessible regardless of where they were purchased. Please note that the Seasonal Candles that come with a Season Pass, and the Gift Passes that come with a Season Pack, will not be available on Nintendo Switch if purchased through Xsolla, Switch players will need to log into their Sky account on a mobile device in order to use them.<br>

The web store often runs promotions for purchases, for example: players received an extra 15 regular [[Currency#Candles|Candles]] with their first purchase during [[Season of Moomin]] on the Sky Web Store.<br>

Players will need to use their Sky ID when Xsolla asks for in-game User ID. Please treat your Sky ID with privacy and caution. Only share your Sky ID with official TGC Support (through official support chat) or specific partners such as Xsolla.<br>
