<section begin="Summary"/>The '''Secret Area''' (also known as '''The Office''') was added to the game in Patch {{v|0.6.0}}. It can be found by players with a sharp eye in the [[Vault of Knowledge]]. The Secret Area is set up as a sort of parallel universe or gateway from the world of Sky into a world much more like our real world, featuring an office block based on the office of the staff behind Sky, [https://thatgamecompany.com/ thatgamecompany].

If you haven't yet visited the Secret Area, it is advised to try and find it yourself and explore it spoiler-free before reading this page. However, note that players will need a [[Secret Area#Founder's Pack|special cosmetic]] item to actually get inside the area properly.<section end="Summary"/>

==Entering the Secret Area==
[[File:Sky- Children of the Light- How to Get the Beta Cape (and other beta questions answered)|right|frameless|250x250px]]
The Secret Area is found near the entrance to the [[Vault of Knowledge]], close to the shallow staircase where players first arrive upon entering the Realm. This area is referred to as the [[Vault#First Floor|First Floor]] or Social Space.

Players can find the hidden entrance to the Secret Area through the back wall on the left of the stairs (when facing the main room on the First Floor). There is a "false" section of the wall that players can walk through, containing a narrow tunnel with wall lanterns to light the way; watch for the {{Icon|Icon_flame.png}} flame icons which appear when walking nearby.
<br>[[File:NPC-secret-area.png|left|thumb|188x188px|NPC at the gate]]
This narrow tunnel opens to a clearing containing orange flowers and a few Red Candles. At the back is a [[Barriers#Cosmetics_Barriers|Barrier Gate]] that requires the player to wear either the Beta Cape or Founder's Cape to enter. (''See the Beta and Founder's Cape sections below''). Alternately, the player can be holding hands with someone wearing either one of the above-mentioned Capes. 

On [[Special Events|special occasions]], an NPC (non-player character) will appear to take your hand and enter the gate with you.

Beyond the Barrier Gate is an area with more orange flowers and Red Candles. There are hints of the real world scattered along the path, taking the form of broken office chairs, a ping-pong table, and a little white dollhouse. At the center of a circular koi pond with a swirling [[Murals|Mural]], there is a stone archway portal standing on a hill. When you're close enough to the portal, muffled voices can be heard, hinting that this portal leads to the "real world."

==Beta Cape==
The original '''Beta Cape''' reward was a '''one-time gift''' from TGC for players who helped test Sky prior to the launch of the global version of the game. They were a huge influence on the game and therefore the Cape was a special "Thank you" for all the time and effort they put into helping create Sky. The Beta Cape is no longer available. In addition, TGC currently does not have plans for additional [[Sky Beta|Beta]] tester rewards and will not be providing the Beta Cape to players retroactively.

<small>''(Disclaimer: The Beta Cape and Founder's Cape share the same icon in-game, but the Wiki uses the white TGC logo for the Beta Cape to help distinguish it from the other).''</small>

==Founder's Pack<span id="Founder's Cape"></span>==
The '''Founder's Pack''' contains the Founder's Cape and {{Cost|115 C}}. It can be obtained by talking to the NPC found on the first floor of the Office, hidden within a hallway blocked by [[Darkness|Darkness Plants]] on the right side of the building. The first time you talk with them they will show off their Cape and hint that it's possible to obtain it; clicking the chat button a second time opens a [[Premium Candle Shop|Shop]] Menu where you can purchase the Founder's Pack. It is somewhat paradoxical that you have to first get into the Secret Area before being able to buy the Cape that lets you in. However, with a bit of patience, you can typically get in the first time by befriending a player with the Cape outside the gate or by waiting until a [[Special Event]] that includes an open house arrives. This cape is '''permanently available'''.

Both Capes are blue on the outside, but the Beta Cape (above) has a '''white interior''' while the Founder's Cape (below) has a '''black interior'''. Both can be used to access the Secret Area. Neither Cape should be confused with the blue Cape from the {{Spirit|Pouty Porter|inline_text}}.

==Contents of the Office==
[[File:Office3.JPG|thumb|300px|Entrance to the Office Building]]
The Secret Area proper contains an office building surrounded by a sea of clouds. Inside are several rooms typically seen in an office space, such as various desks with computers, a meeting area, lounging areas, a small kitchen, and two bathrooms. To the right side is a small hallway blocked by [[Darkness|Darkness Plants]] that contains an [[Secret_Area#Entering_the_Secret_Area|NPC]] who hints that players can obtain their own '''Founder's Cape''' from the store. Close to the entrance is a row of Red Candles and several Sky-related posters hang on the walls of some rooms and hallways. A few [[Dark Crabs]] can even be found wandering inside, although they are harmless and simply roam around.

</gallery>

On the outside of the building, two stairways lead up to a walkway on the second level. To the far-left side of this second level is the entrance to an office studio room that contains a blue and green screen, a desk, a photographic camera, a video camera, a changing room, and a blank white room. This room also features a large couch that functions as a 2-player [[Chat|Chat Bench]], where players can light or deposit a Candle to sit and talk with each other until the Candle burns out, and a [[Shared Spaces|Shared Memory Shrine]].

Here's how you can work better picture angles with the green and blue screen studio: 
[[File:Office camera.jpg|none|thumb|300x300px|A camera guide by @ryumen_sky and @kateuno#7591]]

<br>On the left side of the building exterior sits a gray car with a White Candle on its hood. Similar to the studio room's couch, this car functions as a 4-player Chat Bench where players can sit inside and talk with each other. There is also a [[Message_Shrines|Message Shrine]] near the right side of the entrance to the building where players can leave a short message for others to read.

On the roof of the building is an open, grassy space and a Cannon, which requires players to light a Candle for it to work. Placing a regular White Candle creates a new Red Candle to light, which will launch the occupants of the Cannon into the air at high speed. Some slanted windows can also be found on the outside of the building, both of which are solid.

A vast sea of clouds surrounds the building, where a large robotic creature can be seen walking around. A floating rowboat can also be seen among the clouds, where up to 5 players can sit and talk to each other - unlike the studio room couch and parked car, this Chat Bench does not require any Candles to be lit or placed.

==The International Space Station (ISS)<span id="ISS"></span>==
[[File:Space station 4.jpg|thumb|300px|Far shot of the ISS]]
On certain days, the inside of the Office will be dark, and players will see that the television screen in the meeting room is brightly lit and flashing. Players can journey through the screen to another area – the Space Station, or ISS. There is a lot of room to fly around, and an updraft to make sure players don't fall down too far. Voices can be heard here, sounding like radio signals from a space mission. The only way to leave the Station and return to the Office (which will be brightly lit as usual once the player returns) is to complete the Spirit Quest found there. Once the player has returned, however, they must leave the Office and come back in order to visit the Space Station again. ''Read more on the Spirits of the Office and their schedule below.''

==The Spirits of the Office==
[[File:Broomstick Cat 2.JPG|thumb|275px|Mimi the Broomstick Cat]]
Each day there is a different Spirit Quest to complete in the Office, all of which function as a fun Easter Egg that tell stories about the game's development. However, unlike other [[Ancestor Spirits]], these will not unlock Expressions or any other tangible rewards. They are simply a fun experience to spice up your everyday Office trip.

There are multiple different Spirits, all found either within or near the Office building. Some can be found sitting down somewhere, such as a desk chair, an exercise ball, and even behind a computer. Some of them even speak during their Quest.

Two of the Spirits have slightly special powers: the Space Station Spirit and the Atlas Spirit. No official names exist for any of the Office's Spirits – these are merely attempts at differentiating them. The Space Station Spirit will appear on the ISS during Space Days at the Office and completing its Quest will send the player back to the Office. After completing the Quest for the Atlas Spirit, it will release a [[Creatures#Neutral_Creatures|flying cat]] on a broomstick inside the building, which players may ride around on.
