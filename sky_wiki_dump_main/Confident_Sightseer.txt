The Confident Sightseer can be found on a ledge high above the [[Ice Rink]], directly to the right of the entrance from Valley's [[Valley of Triumph#Social Space|Social Space]]. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

Players with few [[Winged Light|Winged Lights]] can approach this ledge directly from the slide into the Ice Rink - simply slow down to walk for the last section and use the thin ledge to the right of the slide's end. Alternatively, players can use the momentum of the slide to launch into flight and steer towards the cliff.

As their memory unfolds, the Confident Sightseer is seen helping a young Spirit climb the tall ledges along the sides of the Ice Rink. They encourage their small companion to cross the thin arch that stretches between a gap in the cliff before stopping to admire the dazzling view that awaits them at their final destination.

At the end of the memory, the young Spirit sits to play in the sand as the Confident Sightseer stands nearby, still admiring the view. They then turn to call the young Spirit over, holding their arms out to pick up them up in a hug. The Confident Sightseer lifts the young Spirit onto their shoulders and turns to face the Ice Rink, taking in the golden landscape that stretches before them.<br>
