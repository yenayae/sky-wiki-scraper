The Cheerful Spectator can be found in the [[Coliseum]], halfway up the seats and above the entrance from the [[Coliseum#Sliding Race|Races]]. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 1 memory fragment and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Cheerful Spectator stands on their seat with their arms raised to cheer enthusiastically alongside four other Spirits.

At the end of the memory, the Cheerful Spectator hops in place and punches their fists into the air to express their excitement.<br>

*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with sparkles following the punching hand.
*Level 3 will make your avatar hunch forward, wiggling with excitement, and then burst into a high jump up, punching the air with their left fist.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with sparkles and a ray of light following the punching hand.

The prices of the three Expression upgrades are {{Cost|3 C}}, {{Cost|4 C}}, and {{Cost|4 C}}. Levels 3 and 4 are only available after unlocking the Spirit's [[Wing Buff]].

==Trivia==
*Next to the three Spirits ([[Whale Whisperer]], [[Ceremonial Worshiper]], and [[Memory Whisperer]]) that do not have a tradition memory, and therefore no memory fragments to collect, the Cheerful Spectator has the shortest memory relive sequence of all Regular and Seasonal Spirits, with only a single fragment to collect.
*The Cheerful Spectator is featured in a piece of merch from thatskyshop, in the form of the [[That Sky Shop/Wave 11#Valley Spectator Coin Pouch|Valley Spectator Coin Pouch]].
