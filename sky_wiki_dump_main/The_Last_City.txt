==Overview==
[[File:The-Last-City-Directions.gif|thumb|300px|How to enter The Last City through the Vault]]
The Last City is a bustling town at the foot of a great mountain, crowded with people, pipes, and walls. It is home to many refugees who have set up tents along the dusty streets surrounding the [[#Marketplace|Marketplace]] and [[#Cloister|Cloister]]. The Last City is made up of two main areas: the [[#Exterior Streets|Exterior Streets]] and the Marketplace. Three smaller areas can be accessed under certain conditions as well. The player's starting point is a tent next to the [[Vault Elder's Lantern]], at the very start of the area, with the [[#Map Shrine Locations|Map Shrine]] nearby. At the back, there are the Cloister and the Manatee pens with the [[Stern Shepherd]] and [[Caring Companion]], and to the right the Marketplace, where the [[Tender Toymaker]], [[Resourceful Recluse]], and [[Scarred Sentry]] can be found. The Marketplace gives access to the [[#Underground Refuge|Underground Refuge]] and the [[#Temple|Temple]] can be accessed by (re-)playing [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1#Quest #4|Quest #4]] of the Season.

<small>Players will be capeless in the area, and therefore unable to fly, unless they have the {{Spirit Item|Elder's Lantern|cape_u|inline_text}} equipped.</small>

===Children of Light Locations===

==Exterior Streets==
The entrance to The Last City is located here, as well as the [[Vault Elder's Lantern]] and the Map Shrine. The main path leads to the Manatee pens, past the Marketplace and Cloister. The [[Stern Shepherd]] and [[Caring Companion]] can be found in this section of the City. Many interactions between the refugees can be seen, such as musicians, a group of kids, and two people playing a board game.

==Marketplace==
[[File:Last-City-Marketplace.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Marketplace]]
The Marketplace can be found to the player's right when following the main path to the back of the area—the entrance is located between the Manatee pens and the [[Vault Elder's Lantern]]. Vendors' tents crowd the meandering walkway, which end at the gate to the Temple. Players can interact with various vendors by selecting the coin offering button, upon which each vendor will offer a different service, such as serving some tea. In a quiet corner away from the bustle, the entrance to the Underground Refuge can be found. The [[Tender Toymaker]], [[Resourceful Recluse]], and [[Scarred Sentry]] are located in this section.

===Underground Refuge===
The Underground Refuge is introduced in [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1#Quest #2|Quest #2]] and can still be accessed after, by jumping into the hole close to the [[Resourceful Recluse]] to enter. It is a small underground room, lit by sunbeams coming through the ceiling and filled with hanging plants and murals. A moment with the Manatee from [[The Two Embers]] series can be viewed by interacting with the candle beside the stone, in the back of the area.<br><br>

==Cloister==
[[File:The_Last_City_ultimate_area.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Cloister's Interior]]
The Cloister can be found near the back of the village, opposite of the Manatee pens. It is blocked by a [[Barriers#Cosmetics_Barriers|Cosmetics Barrier]] and is only accessible to players wearing the {{Spirit Item|Elder's Lantern|cape_u|inline_text}} and friends holding their hand. A long line of citizens waits outside, with two guards watching the entrance. The Cloister's interior is an ornate enclosed courtyard, lit with a golden glow. In the center is a shallow pool lined with trees and shrubbery.

Every hour at xx:00, xx:20, and xx:40, a cutscene plays of the Vault Elder entering the Cloister, stopping by the pool and raising their arms. The pool glows and lights the entire hall, and once the light fades, a quick recharge spell is applied to the player that lasts 10 hours and 40 minutes.

==Temple==
The Temple is only accessible at the end of [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1#Quest #3|Quest #3]] and during [[Season of The Two Embers - Part 1#Quest #4|Quest #4]], where citizens of the City are besieged by dark creatures. It seems larger than the present-day [[Wasteland Temple]], as the recessed floors have not been buried in sand and polluted water. People are laying around, on mats and in tents, while dark sounds can be heard from outside and the ground shakes occasionally.

The citizens of The Last City will react to many of the players' Emotes.

A non-comprehensive list of other interactions and activities:

*A ball game can be found by the marketplace's entrance.
*Near the Manatee pens, the kids have made a Rock Toss Game for you to play. Throw three stones into the cart to win. Winning grants the player some [[Pieces of Light]].
*Players can purchase items from select vendors at the marketplace, using the hand-offering-coin icon.
*A vendor at the end of the marketplace offers the shell game. Winning grants the player some [[Pieces of Light]].
*Players can irritate the guards by calling or emoting repeatedly close to one, and can be temporarily placed in a jail close to the [[Resourceful Recluse]].
*In an [[Out of Bounds]] area of the exterior streets, players can join in on a yoga session.
