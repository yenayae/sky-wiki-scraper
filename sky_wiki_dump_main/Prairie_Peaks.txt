==Overview==
Prairie Peaks is a serene and enchanting location within [[Daylight Prairie]]. As you venture through this area, you'll find yourself amidst vast prairies and swaying grasslands. The landscape is adorned with vibrant wildflowers surrounded by peaks of stone. Additionally, a river flows through this area with [[Light Creatures]] swimming past it. Light Creatures are abundant in the Prairie Peaks, from [[Birds]] to [[Butterflies]] to [[Light Creatures|Manatees]], they roam all throughout the area, from the rough luminescent caves to the gentle rolling plains.

As real time progresses in Prairie Peaks, the area will adjust with different lighting to reflect the passage of time. Every few minutes, the area will go from Sunrise, Morning, Day, Sunset, Evening, and Night in intervals of 12 minutes.
