<div>{{#ev:youtube|k-gGWR9dhvw||inline|Video Guide}}

The Beckoning Ruler can be found towards the back of [[Starlight Desert]], left of the throne on the floating Crown Island between the Rose Garden and the giant pile of books. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Beckoning Ruler can be seen attempting to boss around some [[Birds]] which have gathered in different spots on their Crown Island. Some Birds pay the Spirit no mind, while others fly away as they approach. The Beckoning Ruler then strides over to a row of stone statues depicting soldiers holding their swords high in the air, and motion them to move several times.

At the end of the memory, the Beckoning Ruler sits on their throne and looks to their left at one of the statues. They stand up to beckon to the statue, but after no response from it, the Spirit walks over and demandingly points at the statue and then towards the ground, motioning them to move once again.

The Little Prince enters the scene and asks, "You know they can't move, right?"

"I am entitled to command their obedience! My orders are reasonable," the Spirit replies before turning back towards the statue. "From now on, stay where you are."

Raising a hand to his chin, the Little Prince contemplates aloud, "Grown-ups are so strange."<br>

* Level 1 will make your avatar tilt to the right, prop up their right arm on their hip, and extend their left arm to wave a hand towards themselves, while a quick, high-pitched squeaky sound effect plays.
* Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a trail of small, glowing, golden sparkles following the motion of your avatar's extended hand, before slowly falling down.
* Level 3 will make your avatar lean slightly forward and extend their right arm to firmly point straight forward, then point down to the ground they stand on, and finally loosely wave both hands towards themselves once, while high-pitched squeaky sound effects play with each motion.
* Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a white trail of light following the motion of your avatar's pointing arm, and a yellow ball of light bouncing at their feet after they point down, trailed by small white sparkles.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
