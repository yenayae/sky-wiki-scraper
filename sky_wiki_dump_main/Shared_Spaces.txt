<section begin="Summary" />'''Shared Spaces''' were introduced to the world of ''Sky'' on {{v|0.13.4|May 31, 2021}} as a new way to play together with others and express yourself using [[Props]], available to players who have progressed to [[Daylight Prairie]]. This feature allows players to decorate a small area, either with the [[Shared Spaces#Shared Space Shrines|Shared Space Shrines]] found in set locations or with [[Shared Spaces#Shared Space Spells|Shared Space Spells]] that can be placed almost anywhere within the [[Realms]]. Once a player has finished decorating and publishes it, a special lantern appears in the world representing the Shared Space. Friends and other players who find it can then view the created Shared Space and interact with the items it contains.<section end="Summary" /><br>

==Overview==
<section begin="Shared Spaces" />Shared Spaces are a type of [[Player Creations|Player Creation]] that offer the ability to decorate an area with [[Props]] in order to craft a customizable, cozy space for you and your friends. While decorating, players have access to all the Props they have purchased and a handful of bonus [[Shared Spaces#Featured Props|Featured Props]] that vary depending on location. In addition to being able to place different Props, Shared Spaces allow multiple copies of a Prop to be placed.

Multiple Shared Spaces can exist at one time, although only one can placed per area. For example, if you already have an existing Shared Space in [[Butterfly Fields]], publishing another there will result in it replacing the previous one. A [[Shared Spaces#Shared Space Spell|Shared Space Spell]] ''can'' exist in the same area as a [[Shared Spaces#Shared Space Shrines|Shared Space Shrine]], however.

There is a limit to the number of Props that can be placed in a Shared Space, which depends on the total "volume" of the items used. Placeable items are sorted in the menu by how much “volume” they use in a Shared Space, listed from left to right. The circular bar surrounding the {{Icon|Shared-space-hammer-Credit-Ray.png|link=}} hammer icon at the top of the screen indicates how full a Shared Space is before no further items can be placed. Props cannot be placed outside the borders of a Shared Space, indicated by glowing blue walls.

The items available for use in Shared Spaces are independent of each other. This means that you can place a Prop in one Shared Space and still have the ability to use that same Prop in another Shared Space without removing it from the first. Props obtained through [[Spells]], such as the [[That Sky Shop/Wave 10#Manta Plush (38")|Big Manta Plush]], cannot be placed in a Shared Space.

A Shared Space must receive one {{Icon|Thumbs-Up-Like.png|link=}} "like" from a player's friends before it becomes public to all players. After giving another player's Shared Space a "like," you can gift the creator a [[Heart]] once per day by spending {{Cost|3 C}}, even if you aren't friends.<section end="Shared Spaces" />

==Creating a Shared Space==
[[File:Shared-Spaces-menu-UI-2.png|right|thumb|200px|Naming a Shared Space]]
There are two ways to create a Shared Space: with a [[#Shared Space Shrines|Shared Space Shrine]] or a [[#Shared Space Spells|Shared Space Spell]]. Using either method, the player will enter "edit mode" which offers several specialized options for designing a Shared Space.

Note that while in this mode, several features are disabled to avoid interfering with the designing process. Other nearby players are hidden from view, special interactions with [[Props]] placed in the Shared Space (such as sitting on chairs or hugging plushies) are disabled, other nearby [[Player Creations]] cannot be interacted with, the [[Expression Menu]] cannot be accessed, and the player cannot bring out their {{Icon|Icon_flame.png|link=}} [[Flame]].<br>
<br>
[[File:Shared-Spaces-menu-UI-1.png|none|thumb|x200px|Shared Space "Edit Mode" UI]]

<br>
The vertical menu in the top left corner of the screen in "edit mode" contains several icons, detailed below. This menu can toggle between being collapsed and expanded by selecting the arrow found at the bottom of the menu. 

*{{Icon|Publish-Space-icon.png|link=}} '''Save and Publish:''' When the player is ready to finish, they will be prompted to give their Shared Space a name before saving and publishing it for others to discover.
**{{Icon|Exit-Ray.png|link=}} '''Leave:''' Exit "edit mode" without saving the Shared Space. This is also done automatically when the player moves far enough away from the boundaries of the Shared Space.
*{{Icon|Clear-All-icon.png|link=}} '''Clear All:''' Removes all Props placed within the Shared Space and returns them to the player's inventory to start again from scratch.
*{{Icon|Edit friend name.png|link=}} '''Preview Mode:''' Toggles "preview mode," which disables the player's ability to move and place Props in exchange for reenabling special interactions with Props placed in the Shared Space and returning access to the Expression Menu. 
*{{Icon|Snap-to-Grid-icon.png|link=}} '''Snapping:''' Toggles "snapping," which aligns placed Props to a grid by snapping them into set positions instead of freely placing them anywhere.<br>
<br>
[[File:Shared Space placeable props.png|none|thumb|x200px|Placeable Props Menu]]
<br>
At the top center of the screen is a {{Icon|Shared-space-hammer-Credit-Ray.png|link=}} hammer icon surrounded by a circular white bar. This bar indicates the total "volume" available in the Shared Space before no further items can be placed. As more items are added to the Space, the bar drains and turns red as it nears empty.

Selecting the {{Icon|Shared-space-hammer-Credit-Ray.png|link=}} hammer icon opens a menu that holds all of the player's [[Props#Placeable Props|placeable Props]] that can be used in a Shared Space. These placeable Props are categorized into three separate tabs, similar to the [[Cosmetics|Prop Outfit Shrine]].

*<!--To be replaced with a more accurate version of the icon-->{{Icon|Quest-star-icon.png|link=}} '''Featured Props:''' This tab contains Props that are available by default within a given region's Shared Spaces, even if the player has not previously purchased them. (''For more information, see the [[#Featured Props|Featured Props]] section below.'')
*{{Icon|Bookcase-icon.png|link=}} '''Large Props:''' This tab contains all Props the game categorizes as "large" and have more "volume" in a Shared Space compared to other items.
*{{Icon|Teacup-icon.png|link=}} '''Small Props:''' This tab contains all Props the game categorizes as "small" and have less "volume" in a Shared Space compared to other items.

===Shared Space Shrines===
Shared Space Shrines are glowing blue crystals found in fixed locations where players can create a Shared Space. Unlike a [[#Shared Space Spells|Shared Space Spell]], the items in these Shared Spaces are saved indefinitely. A published shared space becomes unpublished after 7 days but can be published again. 

Select the {{Icon|Edit friend name.png|link=}} pencil icon on the crystal to begin creating a Shared Space. Once a Shared Space has been saved and published, the pencil icon on the crystal will be replaced by a {{Icon|Four-point-star-Ray.png|link=}} star icon that allows you to edit the existing Shared Space.

A total of 11 Shared Space Shrines are currently available: 

*[[Aviary Village]]: inside the [[Nesting Workshop]], to the right of the front counter (''Only available after completing the [[Season of Nesting#Quest #1|first Seasonal Quest]] from Season of Nesting'')
*[[Aviary Village]]: inside the player's [[Season of Nesting#Nest|Nest]] (''Only available after completing the [[Season of Nesting#Quest #2|second Seasonal Quest]] from Season of Nesting'')
*[[Daylight Prairie]]: on the left side of the [[Daylight Prairie#Social Space|Social Space]], across from the [[Cosmetics#Outfit Shrines|Closets]]
*[[Hidden Forest]]: on a grassy ledge behind the [[The Treehouse|Treehouse]]
*[[Hidden Forest]]: on the highest floating island in the [[Wind Paths]]
*[[Valley of Triumph]]: in the stands of the [[Coliseum]], left of the Temple entrance
*[[Valley of Triumph]]: on top of the Hermit's cave in [[Hermit Valley]]
*[[Golden Wasteland]]: on the far-left shore of [[Treasure Reef]]
*[[Secret Area]]: in the studio room on the second level of the Office building
*[[Vault of Knowledge]]: on the ground floor of the [[Repository of Refuge]] (''Only available after completing the [[Season of Remembrance#Quest #7|seventh Seasonal Quest]] from Season of Remembrance'')
*[[Map:Alice's Wonderland Cafe|Alice's Wonderland Cafe]]: on the coffee table next to the Snow Globe, in the [[Map:Alice's Wonderland Cafe|Wonderland Cafe]] which can be reached via the [[Days of Feast#Wonderland Cafe Corridor|Wonderland Cafe Corridor]].

===Shared Space Spells===
<section begin="Shared Space Spell" />Introduced on February 23, 2023 with the {{v|0.20.5}} Update, Shared Space Spells are a type of [[Spell]] that allow players to create a Shared Space almost anywhere within the [[Realms]]. Unlike [[Shared Spaces#Shared Space Shrines|Shared Space Shrines]], these Shared Spaces last for 7 days before expiring. When placed down, they look like a transparent version of the memory lanterns found throughout the [[Vault of Knowledge]].

Similar to other types of [[Player Creations]], after giving another player's Shared Space a "like," the creator can be gifted a [[Heart]] for {{Cost|3 C}} once per day, even if you aren't friends. This can be given in addition to [[Friendship Menu#Heart Gift|regular Heart gifts]]. Note that you can only send an individual player a maximum of one Heart through one of their Player Creations each day, regardless of how many they have placed in the Realms.<br>
<br>
<gallery widths="125" captionalign="center">

</gallery>

Shared Space Spells can be placed almost everywhere in ''Sky'', other than: 

*[[Home]]
*[[Nest]]
*Parts of [[Nesting Workshop]]
*Near [[Belonging Guide|Grandma]]'s table at [[Elevated Clearing]]
*Near the [[Additional Light Sources#Polluted Geyser|Polluted Geyser]] at [[Sanctuary Islands]]
*Inside the [[Season of Prophecy#The Trials|Prophecy Trials]]
*[[Season of Remembrance|Repository of Refuge]]
*In bounds of a [[Shared Spaces#Shared Space Shrines|Shared Space Shrine]]
*Parts of the [[Eye of Eden]] before [[Eye of Eden#Ascent and Orbit|Orbit]]

Players can buy Shared Space Spells for {{Cost|4 C}} from the [[Home#The Sleepy Traveling Merchant's Boat|Sleepy Traveling's Boat]] at [[Home]], the [[Spell Shops#Forgotten Ark Shops|Forgotten Ark Spell Shop]], or the [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Aviary Village Spell Shop]]. Free Shared Space Spells can be obtained as rewards for completing Seasonal Quests from the [[Season of Remembrance]] and [[Nesting Workshop#Nesting Challenges: Workshop|Nesting Challenges]]. During the Season of Remembrance, a free Shared Space Spell was added to the [[Assembly Guide]]'s Friendship Tree as well.<section end="Shared Space Spell" />

==Viewing Others Shared Spaces==
{{WIP
}}

==<span id="Where to get Props for your Shared Spaces"></span>Placeable Props==
Placeable [[Props]] can be obtained through [[Regular Spirits]], [[Traveling Spirits]], [[Special Events]], and [[Seasonal Spirits]].

The following table lists all the placeable Props that have ever been available in ''Sky''; only a small subset of them are [[#Availability Legend|available]] for purchase at any given time. The default order is icon order, as used in the in-game [[Props]] [[Closet Shrine]]. The table sort order can be changed by clicking on the header of any column. The # column indicates the number of that item that can be placed at one time in a Shared Space. The last column provides the Prop's purpose:
* Chat: an item that allows players to [[Chat]] with each other; the number of players who can sit and chat at one time is provided in parentheses.
* Light: an item that provides light AND allows players to recharge their [[Capes#Cape Energy|Cape Energy]].
* Covering: an item that can protect players from the rain.
* Decoration: an item that has no useful purpose. This includes lights that do '''not''' recharge [[Capes#Cape Energy|Cape Energy]].

===<span id="Featured Props for Shared Spaces"> </span>Featured Props===
Introduced on January 10, 2023 with the {{v|0.20.0}} Update, Featured Props are [[Props]] available by default within a given region's Shared Spaces, even if the player has not previously purchased them. Several Featured Props are items exclusive to Shared Spaces and cannot be used or obtained elsewhere, such as the {{Icon|Shared-Spaces-Brick-prop-icon-Morybel-0146.png|link=}} [[#Shared_Spaces_Brick|Brick]] and {{Icon|Shared-Spaces-Standing-Lantern-prop-icon-Morybel-0146.png|link=}} [[#Shared Spaces Standing Lantern|Standing Lantern]].

These items can be found within the first tab <!--not actually the same icon; it's similar but will need a new vector for accuracy-->(the {{Icon|Quest-star-icon.png|link=}} star icon) of the Placeable Props menu while editing a Shared Space. The following table lists all Featured Props and the locations where they are available to use.

===<span id="Temporary Featured Props for Shared Spaces"> </span>Temporary Featured Props===
Similar to [[#Featured Props|Featured Props]], Temporary Featured Props are [[Props]] available by default within a given region's Shared Spaces, even if the player has not previously purchased them. However, these items are only available for a limited time, such as for the duration of a [[Special Event]].

Temporary Featured Props were introduced on March 4, 2024 with the [[Spring Camping]] event, which added a special Shared Space Shrine in the [[Eight-Player Puzzle Area]] that offered several themed decorative Props. The following table lists all Temporary Featured Props and their associated events where they are available to use.
