Elders are the ancestors specifically found in the temples at the end of each realm. The only interaction with Elders normally is watching a cutscene after lighting the temple's altar.

However, once a realm's Constellation is completed, it is possible to interact directly with an elder in Orbit. 

List of all the Elder pages: 
*[[Elder of the Isle]]
*[[Elder of the Prairie]]
*[[Elder of the Forest]]
*[[Elder of the Valley]]
*[[Elder of the Wasteland]]
*[[Elder of the Vault]]

==Trivia==
The Elders (plus the king & prince) have names based off Hebrew letters from concept development that are no longer canon, though the fandom sometimes refers to them as such:

*Isle – Daleth (ד)
*Prairie – Ayin (ע)
*Forest – Teth (ט)
*Valley – Samekh (ס) (They share a name, though the fandom refers to the spiky hair twin as Sah and the bobbed hair twin as Mekh.)<ref name="valley-elders-alt-names">Because of their haircuts, they are sometimes referred to as Kakashi and Dora, respectively.</ref>
*Wasteland – Tsadi (צ)
* Vault – Lamed (ל)
*Prince – Alef (א)
*King – Resh (ר)

However, it seems the devs refer to the Elders by the times of day their realms represent:

*Isle – Dawn
*Prairie – Day
*Forest – Rain
*Valley – Sunset
*Wasteland – Dusk
*Vault – Night
*Eden – Storm

Those names can be found on [https://www.tomzhao.com/sky1 Tom Zhao's graphics] that was revealed during the [[Seven Days of Sky|Seven Days of Sky.]]
