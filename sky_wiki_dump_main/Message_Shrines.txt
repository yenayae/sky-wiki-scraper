<section begin="Message Candles" />
'''Message Shrines''' (also known as '''Message Candle Spots''') are fixed locations where players can leave a message for others to see. At first it will only be visible to friends, and if the note gets one like it will become public.

There are two types of Message Shrines; Gratitude Shrines and Quest Shrines. Gratitude Shrines are always available, and their message candles are removed after 7 days. However, each Quest Shrine is only available when activated by a [[Quests|Daily Quest]], and their Message Candles are removed after 24 hours<ref>https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/521-what-are-message-shrines-message-candles-message-boats-shared-spaces-candles-and-shared-memories/</ref>.

Players who view a Player Creation can send the creator a [[Currency#Hearts|Heart]] {{Cost|H}} for three candles{{Cost|C}} once they've liked the creation. You don't have to be friends with a player to send them a heart, and you can send them a heart through the creation in addition to gifting them a regular heart every day. 

There are no Message Shrines in Home or Eye of Eden.

== [[Vault of Knowledge|'''Vault of Knowledge''']] ==
There are three Message Shrines in Vault of Knowledge.

=='''Meditation Shrines'''==
There are days in which Meditation Shrines appear at select Message Shrine as part of the Daily Quests. To meditate at a Meditation Shrine, the player must go to the specified location and sit in the glowing circle of light for a few moments. A prompt will appear on the screen with a specific question. After leaving a message, the quest will be complete. <br>
<br>
Note that when deleting the message after completing the Daily Quest, it will still be marked as completed. However, the meditation circle will re-appear and invite players to leave a message.

==Trivia==

As of Patch {{v|0.25.0}}, players can no longer 'passively' receive a heart {{Cost|H}} from earning 'likes'. Previously, players could earn one heart after receiving 50 likes on a Message Candle at a Gratitude Shrine or 10 likes on a Message Candle at a Quest Shrine. The number of likes required to earn a Heart from Message Candles changed as needed to help balance the game and prevent exploitation.
