Sky turns 4 this year, and for the occasion TGC is throwing a big dance party in the Office! From '''July 17, 2023 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' until '''July 30, 2023 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', head to the rooftop to watch some [[Spirits]] perform periodically, bust out your best moves on a shiny new dance floor, and try your hand at a new "sequencer" feature that allows you to record and playback loops of music from a variety of instruments.

A crew of special Spirits will make an entrance on stage in the area, too—catch several performances every hour, with a different lineup each day. Near the Jam Station, players will recognize the percussion, the sound of the Roland TR-909 drums<ref>[https://x.com/thatskygame/status/1683915176959942657 Commentary by lead audio designer Ritsu Mizutani]</ref>, available at the Anniversary Jam Station exclusively during this event!
