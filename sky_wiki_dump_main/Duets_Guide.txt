*Level 1 will make your avatar reach out to take your friend's hand, then raise your arms into the air while standing side-by-side before taking a bow together. After both players straighten up, your avatar will gesture towards your friend as they clasp their hands near their chest, with both players turning to look at each other and straight ahead several times.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, but with more exaggerated movements, both players crossing one leg behind the other as they take a bow together. After both players straighten up, your friend will gesture towards your avatar as they puff out their chest and raise their arms horizontally, with both players turning to briefly look at each other.

Like any [[Friendship Menu#Extended Two-Player Abilities|Extended Two-Player Abilities]], this ability can be upgraded by opening your friend's Friendship Menu. Unlocking the Level 1 ability will cost you {{Cost|32 C}}. After unlocking Level 1, it will cost you {{Cost|34 C}} more to upgrade to Level 2. (See [[Friendship Menu]] to view the entire Friendship Tree.)
