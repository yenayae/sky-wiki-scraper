'''Days of Fortune''' is an annual event celebrating the traditions of the Lunar New Year festival that happens around the end of January and spans over the following 14 days.

During the two-week event, a brightly lit pier appears at the edge of the water in [[Home]] with Spirits from a past [[Seasonal Events|Season]] offering {{Icon|Icon_high_five.png|inline_text|label=High Fives|link=Friendship Menu#High Five}} and other Friend Actions to passing players. In addition to a number of firework shows, a special stone Dragon that drops [[Pieces of Light|Light]] to appears in Home for 8 minutes starting at the beginning of every even hour PST (UTC-8). The [[Secret Area]] is also open to everybody during this event, allowing players to enjoy its skating rink on the building's rooftop.

Lunar New Year-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] are available from the in-game shop, and the Auspicious Visitor and Days of Fortune Event Staff offer various cosmetics from their Friendship Trees. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy_Traveler's_Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] and the present box on the roof of the Secret Area.

''For the occasion, a special gifting node shaped like an envelope {{Icon|Gift-5-hearts.png|link=|label=Fortune Gift Envelope}} also appears in the [[Friendship Menu]] of friends with whom a player has the {{Emote|Piggyback Lightseeker|inline_text}} unlocked, allowing you to gift them 5 [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] for {{Cost|14 C}} by meeting up in-game. The Fortune Gift Envelope can be given once a day per person, like regular Heart gifts and can be given in addition to regular Heart gifts, meaning players can send a maximum of 6 Hearts per day per friend.''

Days of Fortune was back for a sixth year! The event began on '''Monday, January 27, 2025 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and ended on '''Sunday, February 9, 2025 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Auspicious Visitor arrived at [[Home]] and in the [[Aviary Village]], offering to teleport players to the center of this year's action in the [[Valley of Triumph#Ice Rink Slope|Valley of Triumph's Ice Rink]].

Spirits from the [[Season of Prophecy]] returned to celebrate, and brought a new minigame with them! Meditating at the middle of the Ice Rink activated the Snake Game, launching players into the sky above. Collecting the floating yellow lanterns granted Event Ticket Light, and after collecting 5 Tickets worth of lanterns, players would be given a red [[Spells#Trail Spells|Trail Spell]]. After starting the Snake Game, night fell across the Ice Rink. A mysterious snake head also appeared. It circled around the event area, leaving a trail of colorful [[Pieces of Light]] behind, until disappearing after some time.

Alongside the familiar Spirits, the felicitous dragon friend returned to share Light, and they were floating in the air regardless of what time players visited them. Players could also transform into a dragon chain with fellow Sky kids once again. And the [[Secret Area]] accessible from the ground floor of [[Vault of Knowledge]] was also open to all.<br>

For players wanting to gift something special to their friends, the Fortune Gift Envelope was made available during the event. This special gifting node shaped like an envelope {{Icon|Gift-5-hearts.png|link=|label=Fortune Gift Envelope}} appeared in the [[Friendship Menu]] of friends with whom a player had the {{Emote|Piggyback Lightseeker|inline_text}} unlocked, allowing them to gift their friends 5 [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] for {{Cost|14 C}} by meeting up in-game. The Fortune Gift Envelope could be given once a day per person, like regular Heart gifts, and could also be given in addition to regular Heart gifts, meaning that players could send a maximum of 6 Hearts per day per friend.

==January 2024<span id="2024"></span>==
{{#ev:youtube|aUWxUuI-v9k||right|Days of Fortune 2024 Trailer}}
Days of Fortune returned for a fifth year! The event began on '''Monday, January 29, 2024 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)'''  (11 days before LNY's Eve) and ended on '''Wednesday, February 14, 2024 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)'''  (4 days after LNY)<ref name="fortune-2024-extended">Days of Fortune 2024 has been extended from February 11 to February 14, a response to the frequent crashing that Android players experienced in Patch {{v|0.24.3}}.</ref>, lasting '''17''' days. For the duration of the event, the Auspicious Visitor appeared in [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to the [[Valley of Triumph]]'s Social Space. In addition, the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate. 

For the Year of the Dragon, the center of festivities took place at the [[Valley_of_Triumph#Social_Space|Valley's Social Space]], where players could pick up a bit of [[Social Light]] and meet a group of [[Season of Performance|Performance]] Spirits who were back to say hello during the event. Another familiar presence would show up at the '''start of every hour''', too: the felicitous flying dragon appeared, bringing the best beats in Sky, some pyrotechnic Light, and a friendly race for Spirits and Sky Kids. At the countdown, players joined from across game servers with [[Festival Tech]] to race towards the [[Ice Rink]] alongside the felicitous dragon. Night also fell across the area for 10 minutes—the perfect backdrop for the party’s worth of fireworks and Light that the dragon would share.
<!---
TBA: Pictures of Valley at night during the race, the race end, and of the dragon costume spell platform -->

For players who longed for some more of that dragon energy in between those hourly appearances, there was a [[Spell]] for that! Back in the [[Valley of Triumph#Social Space|Valley's Social Space]], a platform next to the Auspicious Visitor offered free Spells that gave players a [[#Dragon Train Costume Spell|dragon costume]] for a limited time. Finding Sky Kids wearing this dragon costume allowed you to form a train of up to eight players.

And for players wanting to gift something special to their friends, the Fortune Gift Envelope was made available during the event. This special gifting node shaped like an envelope {{Icon|Gift-5-hearts.png|link=|label=Fortune Gift Envelope}} appeared in the [[Friendship Menu]] of friends with whom a player had the {{Emote|Piggyback Lightseeker|inline_text}} unlocked, allowing them to gift their friends 5 [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] for {{Cost|14 C}} by meeting up in-game. The Fortune Gift Envelope could be given once a day per person, like regular Heart gifts, and could also be given in addition to regular Heart gifts, meaning that players could send a maximum of 6 Hearts per day per friend. ''Please note that these gifts were not eligible to be doubled during the [[Double Currency Events#Days of Love - February 2024|Double Heart event]] that occurred for Days of Love 2024.''

<small>Days of Fortune content was available to all players who had at least progressed to [[Valley of Triumph]] '''and''' started the [[Season of Revival#Quest #4|4th Quest]] from the [[Hopeful Steward]] in [[Aviary Village]].</small><br>

==January 2023<span id="2023"></span>==
[[File:Days-of-Fortune-2023-TGC-Promo-image.png|250px|thumb|Promotional image - Days of Fortune 2023]]
Days of Fortune returned for a fourth year! The event began on '''Friday, January 20, 2023 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (1 day before LNY's Eve) and ended on '''Thursday, February 2, 2023 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''' (11 days after LNY), lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Auspicious Visitor appeared at the end of the pier in [[Home]], alongside a group of Spirits from [[Season of Enchantment]] that arrived one by one during the first week. In addition, the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate.

For the Year of the Rabbit, [[Home]] was the center of the party. Players joined the friendly faces on the pier to watch a special fireworks show that displayed every hour - and once each show ended, a familiar felicitous figure appeared for players to ignite fireworks that emitted up to a certain amount of [[Pieces of Light|Light]] to collect each day while the [[Nodding Muralist]] danced on its head! While the Spirits had to gradually leave during the second week, the felicitous figure kept the party going until the event ends.

For players wanting to gift something special to friends, there was the Fortune Gift Envelope! This special gifting node shaped like an envelope {{Icon|Gift-5-hearts.png|link=|label=Fortune Gift Envelope}} appeared in the [[Friendship Menu]] of friends with whom a player had the {{Emote|Piggyback Lightseeker|inline_text}} unlocked, allowing you to gift them 5 [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] for {{Cost|14 C}} by meeting up in-game. The Fortune Gift Envelope could be given once a day per person, like regular Heart gifts, and could be given in addition to regular Heart gifts, meaning players could send a maximum of 6 Hearts per day per friend. 

Several new Spells were added to the usual assortment, including special themed fireworks in the shape of three different Sky [[Creatures]]— players could find these on the [[Sleepy Traveling Merchant|Sleepy Traveler]]'s boat. New this year as well, Spirits in all of Sky's [[Realms]] took part in the event, too: relive a Spirit's memory, and they would give you a gift of Light in return!

=== Home Display ===
Every hour (Every even hour PST on and after January 27), there was a sequence of events happening. Starting from xx:00:00 (the first chime of the hourly Home clock), Pieces of Light fell from the sky onto the pier in Home. During the fireworks show, a "sit" button appeared when you approached the end of the pier, where you could sit down and watch the fireworks. However, unlike a chat bench, this pier did not allow a player to chat with strangers or friends that did not have the chat feature unlocked. Then, after four minutes, starting xx:04:00, a Dragon appeared in the main area of Home, with a Spirit dancing on the head of the Dragon. Players could jump or fly onto the dragon and light the eyes of the dragon, but this did not have any functional effects. The music "Dragon Dance" by Vincent Diamante was played during the entire Dragon Dance session. 

Every minute on the minute from xx:05:00 to xx:11:00 (or every minute since the time you entered Home, if you entered or returned to Home in the middle of the event), the Dragon dropped down several large or small (random) firework rockets. The Dragon disappeared at xx:12:00. However it could drop another round of firework rockets just before its disappearance. You or another player needed to ignite and launch them before they disappeared (≈20 seconds). Then, the fireworks exploded in a random direction and Pieces of Light will fell from the fireworks. The Pieces of Light disappeared after 30 seconds, regardless of whether it had already landed on the ground/water, or was still floating in the air. 

During a single Dragon Dance session, a player could collect about 350 Pieces of Light. There seemed to be a daily limit of ≈1000 Pieces of Light that can be collected this way. After reaching the limit, the firework rockets would not generate any more "Wax" or orbs of light for you (other players were still be able to see and collect Pieces of Light). Thus, according to the Daily Light System, you could acquire 9 candles* just from Home each day (including the 23 Pieces of Light from the red candles in Home), if you did not collect any other pieces of Light from other sources since last reset.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>It takes 1026 Pieces of Light for the first 9 Candles in a day. Dragon Dance and Home red candles gave 1000+23=1023 Waxes, only 3 short for nine candles, which was easily achieved by collecting Light from the pier during the fireworks show just preceding the Dragon Dance. 

==== Update ====
Since January 27, the schedule for the display in Home has changed. The changes are as following:

# The schedule of event has changed to every other hour (on the even numbered hours in PST and UTC), instead of every hour. As a result, the frequency of the displays has decreased.
# The 4-minute fireworks show at the pier has been discontinued. 
# As a result of the removal of the fireworks show, the dragon dance now runs from xx:00~xx:08 instead of xx:04~xx:12.
# The net result is the amount of Wax available is reduced. However, if you participate the event until no more Wax is dropped from the fireworks (reach the limit), the amount of Wax you can acquire each day will stay approximately the same. The amount of Wax during the fireworks show is very small compared to the Dragon Dance.

==January 2022<span id="2022"></span>==
[[File:Days_of_fortune_-_promo_image_2022.jpg|250px|thumb|Promotional image - Days of Fortune 2022]]
Days of Fortune was back for a third year! The event began on '''Monday, January 24, 2022 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (7 days before LNY's Eve) and ended on '''Sunday, February 6, 2022 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''' (6 days after LNY), lasting '''14''' days. For the duration of the event, the Auspicious Visitor appeared at the end of a brightly lit pier in [[Home]], alongside a group of Spirits from [[Season of Gratitude]] that arrived one by one during the first week. In addition, the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate.

For the Year of the Tiger, [[Home]] was the center of this merry gathering. The fireworks show displayed every hour during the second week provided a vivid backdrop for games with friends and dance parties for Spirits and Sky Children alike. Last year’s felicitous figure also returned, periodically appearing (every '''two hours''' for the first week and '''every hour''' for the second) to gift items for players to ignite that emitted up to a certain amount of [[Pieces of Light|Light]] to collect each day, and [[Spells#Message Boat Spell|Message Boats]] were be temporarily transformed into [[Spells#Message Lantern Spell|lanterns]].<br>

For players wanting to gift something special to friends, there was the Fortune Gift Envelope! This special gifting node shaped like an envelope {{Icon|Gift-5-hearts.png|link=|label=Fortune Gift Envelope}} appeared in the [[Friendship Menu]] of friends with whom a player had the {{Emote|Piggyback Lightseeker|inline_text}} unlocked, allowing you to gift them 5 [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] for {{Cost|14 C}} by meeting up in-game. The Fortune Gift Envelope could be given once a day per person, like regular Heart gifts, and could be given in addition to regular Heart gifts, meaning players could send a maximum of 6 Hearts per day per friend. 

(''Note: During Days of Fortune, the fireworks show visible from the pier at Home appeared to emit Light for players to collect, but this Light did not add to a player's Candle meter. To offset this bug and ensure the full amount of Light intended for the event was available to players, the felicitous figure that appeared periodically in Home provided an amount of Light equivalent to the combined total of Light originally planned from both sources.)''<br>

<small>Days of Fortune content was available to all players who had at least progressed to [[Valley of Triumph]].</small><br>
