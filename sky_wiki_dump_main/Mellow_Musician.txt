== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|rOrdVv7qGM8||inline|Video Guide}}

The Mellow Musician can be found left of the main entrance to the [[Village Theater]], at the top of some steps between two buildings. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Mellow Musician and the [[Frantic Stagehand]] can be seen carrying a stack of props over towards the Theater. The Frantic Stagehand loads the props onto a sled for easier transport, but the Musician is distracted by something on the other side of the row of buildings. The Musician finds the [[Twirling Champion]] and the [[Cheerful Spectator]] playing music together on their instruments, and forgets about the task at hand. The Stagehand looks around, confused as to where the Musician went. Eventually, the Stagehand finds the Musician bouncing along to the beat of the music that the Champion and Spectator are playing.

At the end of the memory, the Stagehand is seen running over to the Musician, who is bobbing their head along to the song. The Stagehand puts their hands on their hips in response to the sight before them.

*Level 1 will make your avatar bob their head back and forth as if listening to a fun song, while a distinct, faintly electronic beat plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a white glowing circle around your avatar's head and a small burst of light particles spreading and following the head's movement.
*Level 3 will make your avatar close their eyes, sway back a little, and lift up their right leg, before letting it step forward and then bopping their whole body up and down while slowly moving from side to side in rhythm with the music, while a similar beat with a slower tempo plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a white glowing circle around your avatar's head and a burst of small light particles spreading and following the head's movement.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

=== Instrument ===
The [[Instrument]] offered by this Spirit is the '''Electric Guitar'''. It is mainly colored black, with blue and yellow accents, as well as glowing blue strings, costing {{Cost|80 C}} from the Traveling Spirit. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available after unlocking the Friendship Tree's fifth node ({{Cost|66 SC|season=Performance}} total). The player stands while playing the Instrument, which plays 15 notes. Note that the player cannot move around while playing the Instrument, unlike all other Instruments played standing.

The icon for this Instrument features a "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermata fermata]" symbol in its upper left corner. In music notation, this symbol indicates that one can play and hold a note for as long as one wants. The same principle applies to this Guitar, and players are able to hold any note for as long as they want as well. Once the sound of the initial strum fades away, a pleasant hum takes its place for as long as the note is held.

The Electric Guitar plays the melody [[Music Sheet Parts|part]] on Music Sheets. Its [[Instrument Pitch|pitch]] is the one octave lower than the standard {{Spirit Item|Cheerful Spectator|Instrument|inline_text}} (in C major, it covers C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>).

In [[Harmony Hall]], the Electric Guitar can be found in the left room with all the other stringed Instruments, in its own niche in the center of the wall.<br>
