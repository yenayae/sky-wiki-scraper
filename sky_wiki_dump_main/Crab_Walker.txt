== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|xhrGhAAAPXc||inline|Video Guide}}

The Crab Walker can be found in the [[Forgotten Ark]], at the entrance of the [[Dark Crab]] infested caves to the right of the Ark. This Spirit has a [[Collection Memory|collection memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Crab Walker can be seen moving throughout the cave tunnels and goofing around with the Crabs that inhabit it, occasionally doing funny poses to imitate the Dark Creatures.

At the end of the memory, the Crab Walker is surrounded by several sleeping Crabs, with a single one awake and scuttling across the cave floor. The Crab Walker playfully imitates its movements, puffing up their Cape and squatting down while shuffling from side to side. The bustling Crab suddenly attacks the Crab Walker, which jumps up in fear and runs away.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar puff up their Cape, squat down, put their hands behind their back, and imitate a [[Dark Crab|Crab]] walking side to side. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with a big, triple golden halo around your avatar's head.
*Level 3 will make your avatar briefly perform the same motion as in Level 1 but at a quicker pace, then flip over onto their back, arms and legs waving helplessly in the air, imitating a stunned Crab. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. Exiting this Expression will make your avatar rock forward and struggle to stand, before rocking backwards to flip right-side up and land on their feet.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a glowing halo around your avatar's head while they're upright, and golden light particles flowing around their body while flailing on their back.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
