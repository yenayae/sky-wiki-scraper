The Feudal Lord can be found in the [[Crescent Oasis]], to the left of the doorway of the Royal Palace in the village. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Feudal Lord can be seen standing arm-in-arm with the [[Princess]] at the entrance of the Royal Palace, ready to deliver an announcement in front of a crowd of gathered Spirits. They seek the capture of the Nine-Colored Deer and are calling upon the public for help. As the Feudal Lord hangs up a notice with details of their request outside the building, the [[Herb Gatherer]] arrives to the scene, drawn in by the crowd.

At the end of the memory, the crowd has dispersed and the Feudal Lord walks back to the Princess waiting on the steps in front of the Palace's entrance. The Feudal Lord stumbles and trips as they climb the stairs, resulting in the Princess picking them up and carrying them back inside.
