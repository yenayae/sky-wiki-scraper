The Waving Bellmaker can be found in [[Prairie Villages]] on the larger middle island, at the bottom of the path leading to its bell tower. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 2 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Waving Bellmaker is seen jauntily walking along the path towards the bell tower. The Spirit pauses at the base of the structure to peer up at the bell while shading their eyes from the sun with one hand.

At the end of the memory, the Waving Bellmaker climbs the bell tower to clean the very top of the bell with a rag. At some point, a flying boat, heavily laden with jars and headed towards the Prairie Temple, passes by. The Spirit onboard waves to the Waving Bellmaker which prompts them to return the gesture, clinging to the bell to avoid falling as they stand.<br>
