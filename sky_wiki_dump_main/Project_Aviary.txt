Project Aviary is a 4-phase project involving [[Aviary Village]] that repurposed the early vision of [[Home]] from [[Sky: Light Awaits]] as an area for Sky kids to come together for all the different things they might enjoy: making friends, meeting players and Spirits, joining events, relaxing and recharging and so on. It is cited by TGC that Aviary is "part of a larger endeavor that we’re working on to bring the feeling of an ongoing festival to Sky, where everyone can create and spend meaningful time with friends."<ref>https://www.thatskygame.com/news/a-gathering-place-for-the-heart-of-sky-project-aviary/</ref>
