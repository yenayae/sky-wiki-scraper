===<span id="Ultimate Mask">Prophecy Ultimate Mask</span>===
The Prophecy Ultimate [[Mask]] (or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis Anubis] Mask) is a dark gray stone carved to resemble the face of a jackal, with a beige marking below each eye and a bright, crescent-shaped halo pointed downwards behind two tall ears. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available for {{Cost|2 Sh|season=Prophecy}} after unlocking the Friendship Tree's second node.<br>

===<span id="Ultimate Instrument">Prophecy Ultimate Instrument</span>===
The Prophecy Ultimate [[Instrument]] is a blue drum with beige top and bottom and pieces of fabric on one side.  It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available for {{Cost|2 Sh|season=Prophecy}} after unlocking the Friendship Tree's first node. 

The Prophecy Drum has a similar sound to the standard {{Instrument|Drum|inline_text}}, but the Prophecy version has a softer sound, and the tinkling note has a distinct echo. Unlike the standard Drum, the player stands when playing the Prophecy Drum.  

The Prophecy Drum plays the [[Music Sheet Parts|percussion part]] on Music Sheets. As with all percussion Instruments, it offers only 8 sounds, all of which are unpitched sounds that do not correspond to different musical notes. Five sounds are for the actual drum sounds; three are for secondary sounds made by hitting, rubbing, or slapping the side of the drum (or its metal part - triangle sound).

A variant of the Prophecy Drum can be seen in [[Harmony Hall]] on the decorative wall panel behind the front counter, but it cannot be used by players. (Except the Spirit in Harmony Hall can sometimes be seen playing it during [[Harmony Hall#Jam Session|jam sessions]].) However, there is one Prophecy Drum in the [[Village Theater]], at the front right of the stage, that can be used by players who have completed the [[Season of Performance#Quest #3|third Quest]] of the Season of Performance.<br>
