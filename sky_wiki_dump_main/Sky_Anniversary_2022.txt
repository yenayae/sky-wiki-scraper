The Sky Anniversary celebration returned for a third edition, and for the occasion the [[Secret Area]] awaited everyone for the party. The event began '''July 18, 2022 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended '''August 3, 2022 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)'''. <ref name="2022_extended">Sky Anniversary 2022 was originally scheduled to end on July 31, but the end date was [https://discord.com/channels/575762611111592007/575768778789617674/1000213305635385524 extended to August 3] to accommodate users impacted by the DDoS server issues.</ref>

Just like previous years, the Office's interior was decorated to suit the occasion. The Anniversary Guide at the entrance of the Office was full of new [[cosmetics]], [[Props]], and Birthday Cake Spells.           

On the rooftop, there was a large stage with multiple chat picnic tables, an ice cream cart full of Spells, and Spirit guests everywhere - making this location the best place to gather with your friends or showcase your talents on stage.  Every hour, starting at reset at '''00:00:00 PST/PDT''', mini events took place:          

* 8 additional Spirits appeared on the stage to perform "Happy Birthday" while the Spirit guests gathered around to applaud them.
*An invisible wall appeared around the stage and a tiny spell transformed every Sky kid inside for about 2 minutes.
*A Spirit performed magic, making different creatures appear on stage.
*The big cannon shot confetti, filling the entire roof when players used it.
*And many more....

Most of the collectibles were available from the Anniversary Guide, found at the entrance of the Office. The one exception was the Electric Blue Guitar from the [[Sky Anniversary#TGC Guitar Pack|TGC Guitar Pack]], which is sold by the NPC who sells the [[Founder's Pack]].
