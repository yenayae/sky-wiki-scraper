'''Days of Bloom''' is an annual event celebrating the arrival of spring that usually happens the mid-end of March and lasting until the beginning of April.

During the event, [[Home]] gets a flowery makeover. A barren tree will appear in Home, signaling the event will begin in a few days and the Hidden Forest portal will adorn purple tree Wisteria branches. The Bloom tree at Home will go through various states of blossoming over the course of the event. During some states, players will be able to collect [[Pieces of Light|Light]] as it falls from the tree—the amount of Light that falls varies based on its bloom state. Several visiting [[Spirits]] can also be found relaxing under the lavender Bloom tree in [[Hidden Forest]] social space to enjoy the festivities together with players.

Spring-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] are available from the in-game shop, and the Days of Bloom Event Guides offer various cosmetics from their Friendship Trees. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy_Traveler's_Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] and the Spell Shop in the Forgotten Ark.

<section begin="TLP Collab" />
Spring was just around the corner, and this time it bloomed alongside a friend very dear to our hearts. This year's Days of Bloom ran from '''Monday, March 24, 2025 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' through '''Sunday, April 13, 2025 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''21''' days. For the duration of the event, the Bloom Guide stood at [[Home]] and [[Aviary Village]], offering to teleport players to the [[Starlight Desert|Starlight Desert's]] Rose Garden.

TGC once again collaborated with the titular story of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's [[wp:The Little Prince|The Little Prince]] (French: Le Petit Prince). During the Sky x Le Petit Prince Encore event, the Little Prince invited players back to the stars to experience his timeless story again. For those who had been not-so-quietly hoping, the complete set of [[Season of The Little Prince#Spirit Memory Quests|Little Prince Season Quests]] returned, presented in full color. But this limited-time event wasn’t only about revisiting ''his'' story.<section end="TLP Collab" />

Players also had a chance to share their own story too! Throughout the event, players could create rose messages—special notes that bloom from the earth, just like message boats but rooted in the landscape.

== March 2024 <span id="2024"></span>==
{{#ev:youtube|HeYCLa4u9So||right|Days of Bloom 2024 Trailer}}
After the storms and the rains, the flowers returned at last - bringing with them Days of Bloom! The event began on '''Monday, March 25, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended on '''Sunday, April 14, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', lasting '''21''' days. For the duration of the event, the Bloom Guide appeared in [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to [[Prairie Peaks]] in Daylight Prairie.

The heart of this year’s celebration was the Prairie Peaks, which gradually transformed over the course of the 3-week event, as seasonal storms made way for a landscape of vivid blossoms. There were three phases, each spanning a week:
* '''1st Week:''' Rainstorms (including lightning strikes) arrived in Prairie Peaks, and [[Social Light]] appeared on the river.
* '''2nd Week:''' Rainstorms ended and more flowers began to grow as the water from the rains filled the river (and added more Social Light). Additionally, a meditation circle that offered the ability to transform into a [[Jellyfish]] appeared.
* '''3rd Week:''' The river returned to its regular level as Prairie Peaks reached, well, peak bloom.

From the 2nd week onwards, a meditation circle near the Bloom Guide in Prairie Peaks allowed players to transform into a Jellyfish to see and join players from across game servers with [[Festival Tech]] to soar above the meadows and between the mountain tops.

During Sky’s annual celebration of nature’s transient beauty, players could also find returning favorites from previous years—tranquil trees returned to [[Home]] and the [[Hidden Forest#Social Space|Hidden Forest's Social Space]], and the [[Season of Lightseekers]] Spirits were at the [[Forgotten Ark]] to welcome the wildflowers (and migrating [[Butterflies]]!) that turned the desert sands in a rainbow of colors.

<small>Days of Bloom content was available to all players who had at least started the [[Season of Revival#Quest #4|4th Quest]] from the [[Hopeful Steward]] in [[Aviary Village]].</small><br>

[[File:Days-of-Bloom-2023-Promo-image.png|thumb|Promotional image - Days of Bloom 2023|250x250px]]
This year’s Days of Bloom events were expanded from two weeks to three, from '''00:00 on March 20''' and until '''23:59 April 9''' (all times PDT, UTC -7). Spirits from the [[Season of Lightseekers]] returned to the realms to take in the renewal that awaits.

Although the biggest spectacle was in Forgotten Ark, two familiar trees emerged elsewhere, one in [[Home]] and the other in the [[Hidden Forest]]'s Social Space.

Free Spell versions of all new and returning Days of Bloom items were available in Home and in the Spell Shop in the Forgotten Ark so that all players had a chance to enjoy them. ''Days of Bloom was available to all players who had progressed to at least Golden Wasteland.''

Across four phases, life emerged from the sands and grew into a lush, vibrant meadow full of life:

* Phase 1: rain clouds rolled through and a Lightseekers Spirit cast spells to help new sprouts emerge.
* Phase 2: a trail of petals appeared on the wind for players to glide upon.
* Phase 3: from March 27 through April 6, the desert turned into an oasis. The trail of petals emitted Light to collect every couple of hours. (During this phase, players had the chance to join a large group of Sky children, utilizing the [[Festival Tech]] feature. Meditating at a shrine near the Lightseekers Spirits allowed players to join hundreds, even thousands of other players gathered in the Forgotten Ark and transformed them into butterflies. ) ''Note: Some Light was available only while in butterfly form.''
* Phase 4: flowers reached the end of their bloom and eventually faded out.
