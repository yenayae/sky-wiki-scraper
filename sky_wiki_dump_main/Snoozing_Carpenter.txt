The Snoozing Carpenter can be found in front of the [[Forgotten Ark]], on the player's left side when entering the area. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 6 memory fragments and a 10-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Snoozing Carpenter can be seen reading an instruction manual on how to build the cloth coverings seen across the Ark. The Spirit then gets to work building more tent-like coverings, and works down the length of the Ark until they get closer to the bow of the ship. Once they reach the front end of the ship, they lean against a large stone vase for support.

At the end of the memory, the Snoozing Carpenter looks out across the Ark, seeing all the work they have done. They turn around afterwards and prop themself up against the large vase, nodding off as they do.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar repeatedly and slowly let their head fall and lift it up again, each time letting it fall deeper and softly sway it from side to side, while gentle lullaby plays until reaching the end position. Your avatar will remain like this until they are moved, causing them to quickly shoot up straight to the sound of an alarm and look around with their arms slightly lifted in front of them.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a flock of small light particles spiraling around your avatar's head, spreading out more and more during the Expression. Once your avatar has finally let their head fall and does not lift it again, several "Z" letters will quickly flicker and overlap each other in front of your avatar, accompanied by a soft snoring sound. When they wake up, a flock of small white clouds will sudddenly appear.
*Level 3 will make your avatar let their head fall on their chest, collapse to the ground with their arms weakly supporting them, and let their head touch the ground, while a longer lullaby plays. Your avatar will remain in this position until they are moved, causing them to wake up to an alarm sound effect, put their palms on the ground and look around left and right before assuming a crouched position and finally standing up, still looking from side to side while squeaking sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a trail of white light particles following your avatar's head, as well as small, white, individual "Z"-shaped letters floating up from their head, with snoring sound effects.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
