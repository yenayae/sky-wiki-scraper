==Compatibility==
STAR features are compatible with: 

'''<big>iOS;</big>'''

*iPhone 7 or later (iPhone 8 and later is most optimal)
*Require iOS 13 or higher

<big>'''iPadOS;'''</big>

*'''Currently''', there are no iPads that support NFC technology

'''<big>Android;</big>'''

*Android NFC enabled devices

<big>'''Nintendo Switch;'''</big>

*All Nintendo Switch Models (Regular and Switch Lite) can scan STAR/NFC; some pins may have difficultly scanning due to the design and shape of the pin's back paired with the Switch's NFC reader being behind the right control stick. Please be careful while scanning as you may scratch the Switch's screen.
*While the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller has the ability to scan NFC, the design and shape of the STAR pin's backs doesn't allow them to be close enough to the reader to scan.

<big>'''PlayStation;'''</big> 

*'''Currently''', PlayStation does not support NFC technology


<small>'''We recommend testing the usability of your device’s NFC before buying NFC embedded products.'''</small>

==How to scan STAR==
Depending on your device, you will first have to open the in-game settings, then go into the '''STAR''' option. Most devices can scan the STAR on the back of the phone. It may take a few tries to scan it due to the high proportion of brass in most items, requiring the scanner to have higher sensitivity and a closer contact. Therefore more recent NFC-enabled devices will be most optimal and recommended.<br /><sub>If the Device has NFC always enabled, you will not have to open the in-game menu each time. You can simply scan it anytime anywhere (when NFC is enabled)</sub>

===iOS/iPhone===
You can scan a STAR Item on an iPhone by placing the STAR on the back of the head of the phone. You will have to open the in-game STAR option every time you want to scan one. 
[[File:How_to_scan_STAR_pins_on_iPhone_7%3F|none|thumb|300x300px]]

===Android===
'''Make sure your device supports NFC Technology; you can usually check by searching <nowiki>''</nowiki>does [DEVICE] have NFC<nowiki>''</nowiki>''' '''online'''

Firstly, you must have NFC enabled on your device. On most devices, you can enable it by entering your Notification Center (swipe down from the top of the screen), and enabling NFC from the Tool Bar (You may have to look through multiple pages to find it). You can also enter Settings and then search for NFC. Most, ''but not all,'' devices will let you be able to scan STAR anytime anywhere, although requiring NFC to be enabled during it. Some devices will need to open the STAR option everytime.

Most Android devices can scan the STAR Item on the back of the phone. Different models may have varying locations, you can check where to scan with your specific device by searching it up online.
[[File:How_to_scan_STAR_pins_on_Samsung_Galaxy_S10?|none|thumb|300x300px]]

=== Nintendo Switch===
[[File:Secret of the Prairie Pin Switch.jpg|alt=Depicted is a Secret of the Prairie pin placed on the right joycon controller. The pin is pushed slightly under the joycon from the right side, with the Star tag rotated as closely towards the joycon as possible.|thumb|300x300px|Placement for the Secret of the Prairie on the Switch.]]
You can scan the STAR Item by putting the STAR under the joystick of the Right Joy-Con. You will have to open the in-game STAR option every time you want to scan one. 
[[File:How_to_scan_your_STAR_pins_on_nintendo_switch|none|thumb|300x300px]]

===Other Devices===
You can find other videos and explanations for scanning STAR in [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdprnFhVJA3TBxsBYQt0-ZA/videos thatskyshop's YouTube Channel.]

==Trying a STAR Item for the first time==
When scanning a STAR item for the first time, Sky should ask the player if they’d like to bind the item to their account. This action '''can not''' be undone and is meant to be permanent. Each item can only be bound to a single Sky account.

==STAR Serendipity==
[[File:STAR-serendipity.png|thumb|STAR Serendipity icon]]
The Serendipity matchmaking feature allows players with linked STAR items to match with other players also with linked STAR items who are online and not already their friend. This feature can also happen with (already known) Facebook Friends, find out more here.

To utilize the Serendipity matchmaking system, follow these steps: 

#Open the "Favorite" Friends constellation in Home
#If you have a match, a Pin Icon with a red notification dot will appear, outside the main constellation
#Tap the star to cause the matched player’s character to appear, in the form of a stranger (darkened character)
#Above the character will appear the Warp Icon, tapping it will teleport you to them like any other friend.

The matched player will have a tag (Pin Icon similar to the one you tapped before) over their head so you can recognize them. You can tap on your character to reveal the tag if they are too far away, but it will appear automatically if you are close to them.
