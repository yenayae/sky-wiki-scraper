== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|fMZdaF0WRC8||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Grateful Shell Collector can be found in the [[Sanctuary Islands]] at the entrance of a large cave, located at sea level and to the left side of the main island if entering from [[Bird Nest]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Grateful Shell Collector can be seen making their way through the main island, looking for seashells to collect. The Spirit spots one shell at the bottom of the cave, then goes up to the higher opening in the cave, where they meet the waving [[Sanctuary Guide]], standing next to another shell. The two Spirits then venture into one of the long and winding tunnels above the cave mouth, making their way down the slide. After they exit the tunnel, the Sanctuary Guide offers a shell to the Grateful Shell Collector.

At the end of the memory, the Grateful Shell Collector and the Sanctuary Guide stand in the shallow water of the beach, keeping an eye out for more seashells. The Sanctuary Guide then approaches the other Spirit with another discovered shell. The Grateful Shell Collector bows their head and shakes their clasped hands in thanks.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar bring both hands up to press against their cheeks, before bowing their head and shake their clasped hands infront of them, while wooden xylophone sound effects play.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a pink heart appearing above the head during the first half of the Expression, and a shower of white light particles falling from the avatar's clasped hands during the second half of the Expression.
*Level 3 will make your avatar sway a bit while holding their hands over their heart and pat one hand with the other, before bowing slightly with crossed legs and opening up their arms wide in a gesture of thanks, while higher wooden xylophone sound effects play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with multiple small red hearts flying up and surrounding the avatar, as well as white light particles following their hand movements.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
