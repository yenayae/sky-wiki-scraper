== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|x7GGq7Ef_cQ||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Peeking Postman can be found in the [[Village of Dreams]], behind a building in front of the [[Dreams Guide]]. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute [[Timed Memory|time limit]].<br>
<br>
As their memory unfolds, the Peeking Postman can be seen striding alongside the back of the buildings in the Village with a sled full of packages to be delivered. They coincidentally spot the [[Bearhug Hermit]] walking in the snow and promptly hide behind a building, peeking at the Spirit. After the Hermit has gone a bit further, the Peeking Postman is greeted by the young Skater, and the two unite in their pursuit of the Bearhug Hermit. They carefully follow the Spirit on their hike up a hill, when the Hermit suddenly turns around and spots their two pursuers, making them jump up in surprise.

At the end of the memory, the Bearhug Hermit waves at the young Skater and the Peeking Postman. The Peeking Postman immediately hides under their Cape and takes a few moments before regaining confidence and letting their temporary shelter fall.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar lift up their left arm and hide behind their cape, before peeking outside. Your avatar will remain in this peeking position until you move; when you do, your avatar will bring down their arms, joining their hands at their chest. Each motion is accompanied by high whisle notes, except for when the avatar is not moved during the Expression.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with light pink circles adorning your avatar's cheeks and two red heart flying up during the last part of the Expression, once the avatar has been moved.
*Level 3 will make your avatar hesitantly take a small step to the side, before turning their back and lifting up their cape just enough so they can hide behind but still peek over it. Your avatar will remain in this peeking position until you move; when you do, your avatar will move down their cape and timidly wave their left hand in greeting. Each motion is accompanied by high whisle notes, except for when the avatar is not moved during the Expression.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with lots of red hearts flying up before your avatar hides under their cape, as well as two pink circles adoring their cheeks, and a small trail of white sparkles appearing at their hands at the end.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
