'''Returning Spirits''' is a system where a group of [[Seasonal Spirits]] with a specific theme<ref name="theme-based visit">The selected Spirits are based on a theme, not a [[Season]], as confirmed by [https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1658025739445473280 this tweet].</ref> return for 1-2 weeks to offer their collectibles, appearing together in specific locations within the [[Realms]]. Similarly to [[Traveling Spirits]], these visits are the only way for players to obtain [[Expression]] upgrades, [[Cosmetics]], and a [[Wing Buff]]<ref name="wing buff">The Wing Buff offered from a Returning Spirit is the same one offered as a [[Traveling Spirit]].</ref> from past-Season Spirits. This event is called a "'''Special Visit'''" (also known as a "'''Group Visit'''" by the community).

While it is not to be confused with Traveling Spirits, the Returning Spirit system is essentially a group of Traveling Spirits that return all at once and for longer than 4 days. In addition, both systems can overlap and run together, meaning a Traveling Spirit could happen while a Special Visit is occurring.

See [[Spirit Visits]] for all Spirit appearances and statistics based on them. 

== Overview==
On March 3 2023, TGC made an announcement about trying something new that will complement the current [[Traveling Spirits]] system that would allow players to be able to interact with past [[Seasonal Spirits]] more frequently, without overwhelming players.<ref>For more information, see the [https://www.thatskygame.com/news/updates-to-shared-spaces-and-returning-spirits/ announcement on TGC's website].</ref> TGC will be testing out different solutions over the course of the year. 

Similar to Traveling Spirits, Special Visits occur when past-Seasonal Spirits return for a limited time, allowing players to purchase items they have previously missed. Even players who have completed the Spirit's [[Friendship Tree]] during its Season can benefit, acquiring one new [[Wing Buff]]<ref name="wing buff" /> with each Spirit. At times, new items may be added to a Spirit's offerings; such as [[Props]] for [[Shared Spaces]].

Returning Spirits provide an opportunity for new players to (eventually) acquire all of the [[collectibles]] offered by Seasonal Spirits. This does not include Seasonal Pendants or Ultimate Gifts from past Seasons (all of which were offered by the Season Guides, not the Season Spirits).<ref name="ultimates">thatgamecompany has mentioned [https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-mobile-switch/faq/609-what-are-traveling-spirits/ future plans to bring back Ultimate Gifts using some other mechanism], but details have not been announced.</ref>

Only players who have completed [[Valley of Triumph]] can see the Returning Spirit's Season Guide at [[Home]]. This means you must have been to the [[Valley Temple]] and must have meditated at its altar; you do '''not''' have to find any Spirits, unlock any Expressions, or buy any Cosmetics.

Players who have previously purchased items from a Returning Spirit or Traveling Spirit (either during their Season or a previous visit) will see those as unlocked items in the Spirit's Friendship Tree. This includes Cosmetics, higher level [[Expressions]], [[Heart]]s, [[Wing Buffs]], and some [[Blessings]].

Only Seasonal Spirits return as Returning Spirits, so [[Ancestors#Guides|Season Guides]] will not return as Returning Spirits, but TGC has mentioned that they will return in some form, bringing their cosmetics.

==Schedule==
'''As of August 22 2024, there is no clear schedule of Special Visits as announced by ThatGameCompany'''. However, it can be ''<u>assumed</u>'' that Special Visits will occur approximately every Season.

Because this Special Visit was based on the "Twilight Gloaming" theme, the Cave of Prophecies had a special lighting during the visit. According to [https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1658025739445473280?s=20 TGC on twitter], "Back in March, the community voted for a Special Visit themed under “Twilight Gloaming,” hence the beautiful hues of blue and purple on these special visitors!".

==Future Returning Spirits ==
On March 9 2023, TGC created a Twitter poll<ref>[https://twitter.com/thatskygame/status/1634011356184862721 Twitter poll]</ref> to allow the community to choose the next group of Returning Spirits. The final result after 9,912 votes were:
{| class="article-table"
|Sunset Eventide||26.6%
|-
!Twilight Gloaming||44.7%
|-
|Verdant Seascape||15.6%
|-
|Grassy Loam||13.1%
|}
Later, the May 15 2023 visit, Twilight Gloaming, was revealed to be a group of [[Returning Spirits#May 15 2023|Season of Prophecy]] Spirits. TGC also elaborated on the hints given above, that the Twilight Gloaming visit was based on a theme, ''not'' on a Season <ref name="theme-based visit" />. 

==Trivia== 
* The May 15, 2023 "Twilight Gloaming" Returning Spirit group is the only group to only have three Returning Spirits rather than the typical four.
