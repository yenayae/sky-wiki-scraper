The Stealthy Survivor can be found in the [[Graveyard]], in a tunnel to the left of the largest cave structure. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 4 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. Beware the [[Dark Dragon]] that patrols nearby, as it occasionally crosses the path of the Spirit's memory.

As their memory unfolds, the Stealthy Survivor cautiously traverses the dangerous landscape, watching their surroundings closely as they head into the large structure.

At the end of the memory, an alerted Dark Dragon passes its gaze over the entrance of the structure. The Stealthy Survivor flattens themself in a crouch against the wall of the structure, hiding as they wait for the Dark Dragon's beam of red light to leave.<br>

== <span id="Expression">Stance</span>==
The Stealthy Survivor offers the {{Emote|Stealthy Survivor|inline_text}}, which will give your avatar a sneaky look, with their arms held out and torso crouched low to the ground. The Stance will affect your avatar's position when standing, kneeling, sitting, and lying down. 

This Stance is popular amongst players in combination with the [[Chibi Mask]], as it helps position your avatar closer to the ground for the popular "[[Chibi Fall]]" glitch.<br>
