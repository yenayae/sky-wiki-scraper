'''Days of Feast''' is an annual event celebrating the cozy festivities of the winter holidays that happens around the mid-end of December and lasting until the beginning of January the following year.

During the three-week event, [[Home]] gets a frosty makeover, with the skies shifting each week as a blizzard gradually rolls through before clearing away. The ice rink emits [[Pieces of Light|Light]] that resembles falling snow for players to collect as they skate and the [[Belonging Guide]] can be found within the snow hut with goodies to share. Several visiting [[Spirits]] can also be found gathering in the [[Village of Dreams]] to enjoy the festivities together with players. The [[Secret Area]] is open to everybody during this event, featuring appropriately themed decorations and a large ice rink on the building's rooftop. 

Winter-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] are available from the in-game shop, and the Days of Feast Event Guides offer various cosmetics from their Friendship Trees. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy%20Traveler's%20Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] and the Snowman Spell shop on the roof of the Secret Area.

While the event was active, players could spot a creature who's in a hurry, in [[Home]] and the [[Aviary Village]]. Following them led to the entrance to an all-new event area where players experienced Sky from a very different perspective.

[[File:Days-of-Style-Event-Currency-Light.png|125px|thumb|Days of Feast Event Currency Light]]
[[File:Days-of-Feast-Snowflake-Ticket.png|125px|thumb|A Days of Feast snowflake Ticket]]
A total of {{Cost|5 T|event=Feast}} Tickets could be collected each day as Event Currency Light, by participating in activities that helped the Alice in Wonderland NPCS. In addition, a bonus {{Cost|15 T|event=Feast}} Event Currency Tickets were hidden throughout the Alice's Wonderland Cafe area. They could be collected at any time during the event.

</gallery>

Players could also buy additional Tickets (costing {{Cost|2 AC}} or {{Cost|6 C}} each) from the Feast Gift Box at the [[Aviary Village#Aviary Village Cafe|Cafe]] or the Snowman at the roof of the building in the [[Secret Area]].

In addition to Event Currency Light, players could gather approximately 250 [[Pieces of Light]] scattered around the area by burning [[Flora, Minerals and Elements of Sky#Dark Plants|Dark Plants]], lighting large red candles, and picking up small Mushrooms.  

When sitting down at the Mad Tea Party table, one NPC would already be sitting there by default, generating one Piece of Light on the table, every few seconds. 
This process could be sped up by completing the two daily Event Currency activities in the area, after which the remaining two NPCs would join the Tea Party. Now players would receive a total of three Pieces of Light every few seconds. There was a maximum of 500 Pieces of Light that could be collected by players at the Tea Party per day.                   <small>Note that the player had to be seated at the table in order to be able to receive the Pieces of Light.</small>

Every 45 seconds, the Mad Hatter would shout, "MOVE ALONG!" - shortly after, the {{Icon|Shuffle-seat-icon.png}} shuffle seat icon would appear. Selecting the icon would soon make the player hop to the next seat in counter-clockwise direction. Players could get thrown off their seat by the person seated right next to them if they did not select the shuffle icon in time.

==December 2023<span id="2023"></span>==
{{#ev:youtube|8WPi4UEwKcg||right|Days of Feast 2023 Trailer}}
Days of Feast was back for a fifth year! The event began on '''Monday, December 18, 2023 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and ended on '''Sunday, January 7, 2024 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''21''' days. For the duration of the event, the Winter Courier and [[Bearhug Hermit]] appeared in [[Aviary Village]] while the [[Belonging Guide]] appeared in [[Home]]. In addition, the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate.

This year’s additions might be just the thing for Sky Kids who feel the need for speed: a new selection of races! Sit at the meditation circle in [[Aviary_Village#Aviary_Event_Store|Aviary's Event Store]] to be teleported to that day’s race in one of the Realms, where players can tackle a variety of slopes to challenge their parkour and flying skills. A new permanent [[Prop]] has also been added to the Equipment Rack in Aviary's Event Store that allows players to create their own race courses throughout the Realms or even inside [[Shared Spaces]]. In addition to the standard [[Home]] and [[Secret Area]], and the new [[Aviary Village]], several other locations also received snowy transformations for the occasion: [[Isle of Dawn]], [[Daylight Prairie]], and [[The Wind Paths]].<br>

It's the time of year for traditions, too, so the event content from previous years have returned as well: [[Social Light]] with Grandma in the cozy snow hut at Home, games of Skyball in the [[Village of Dreams]], and a mysterious [[Bearhug Hermit|Spirit]] leaving footprints around the Dreams Village with a known allergy to lower elevations—don’t stand too close when they sneeze, or you might feel the effects of a [[Days_of_Feast#Hermit_Snowman_Spells|snowy transformation]].

Days of Feast also includes a celebration to welcome in the New Year as it arrives across the globe - fireworks will appear in Home and Aviary Village at the start of every hour for five minutes, beginning '''December 31 at 02:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (midnight January 1 for Kiribati, the earliest New Year) and ending '''January 1 at 04:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (midnight January 1 for Howland Island, the latest New Year).

<small>Days of Feast content is available to all players who have completed at least the 4th Season of Revival Quest.</small><br>

**"Tell you a secret - a pro will take advantage of flight and skiing techniques."

== December 2022<span id="2022"></span>==
[[File:Days-of-Feast-2022.png|250px|thumb|Promotional image - Days of Feast 2022]]
Days of Feast returned for a fourth year! The event began '''Monday, December 19, 2022 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and ended '''Sunday, January 8, 2023 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''21''' days. For the duration of the event, the [[Belonging Guide]] and [[Bearhug Hermit]] appeared in [[Home]], and the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate.

This year in Valley of Triumph, the [[Village of Dreams]] and [[Hermit Valley]] got updates to invite players to gather for friendly competition, or perhaps something more chill. In Hermit Valley, a new permanent race course allowed you and a fellow player to satisfy that need for speed, or for [[Pieces of Light|Light]] (or both). Further down the slope in the Village of Dreams, the Bearhug Hermit periodically came down from their usual spot to observe the fun - but be careful if you stand too close to them when they sneeze. You never know [[#Hermit Snowman Spells|what may happen]]… Also around the Village of Dreams rinks are places added to fish for Light, or to enjoy a game of [[Days of Feast#Tournament Skyball Set|Skyball]] with some new equipment.

Days of Feast also included a celebration to welcome in the New Year as it arrived across the globe - fireworks appeared in Home at the start of every hour for five minutes, beginning '''December 31 at 02:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (midnight January 1 for Kiribati, the earliest New Year) and ending '''January 1 at 04:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (midnight January 1 for Howland Island, the latest New Year).<br>

[[File:Days_of_Feast_2021.jpg|250px|thumb|Promotional image - Days of Feast 2021]]
Days of Feast returned for a frosty third year!

For the duration of the event, the [[Belonging Guide]] appeared in [[Home]] and the [[Secret Area]] was open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate.

This year, the colder weather also brought a snowstorm, transforming Home in three phases, each of which provided up to a certain amount of [[Pieces of Light|Social Light]] that could be collected each day in the area. During a snowstorm, the Belonging Guide could be found inside the comfort of an igloo-shaped shelter where you could collect Light from the heat of a fireplace.

In addition to the usual festive Secret Area decor, the building's rooftop featured a large ice rink and ample space to practice your favorite ice-skating moves. The many trees with bright Christmas lights created a magical setting, especially with snowflakes floating down from above. In addition, three new NPCs with many themed collectibles to enjoy could be found; a Snowman full of free [[Spells]] and two Days of Feast Staff Spirits that offered both new and returning items from previous years. The two Staff Spirits also had a few lines of [[#NPC Dialogue|dialogue]] encouraging the player to play Skyball and some commentary on the new [[Social Light|Social Light Areas]].

Days of Feast also included a celebration to welcome in the New Year as it arrived across the globe - fireworks appeared in Home at the start of every hour for five minutes, beginning '''December 31 at 03:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (midnight January 1 for Tonga, the earliest New Year) and ending '''January 1 at 04:00 PST (UTC-8)''' (midnight January 1 for Howland Island, the latest New Year).<br>
