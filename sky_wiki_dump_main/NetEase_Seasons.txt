'''[[Seasonal Events]]''' are limited-time themed events that come with the option of purchasing an [[Seasonal Events#Season Pass|Season Pass]], which allows players to access extra Cosmetics and Expressions during the Season in exchange for an in-game purchase.

==Seasonal Events==
Similar to ''Sky'', Seasonal Events in ''Light-yu'' are a continuous feature! Each Season lasts around nine to eleven weeks. During this time, a limited number of Expressions, Cosmetics, Props, Instruments, Calls, and Stances are accessible from Seasonal Spirits. However the schedule in ''Light-yu'' is behind by a few weeks.

Seasons behave exactly like in ''Sky'', however at times there may be certain optimizations, changes, and unique features only found within ''Light-yu'' - for example the Lightseeker Guide's Mask was available (albeit not in the same season).

== Seasonal differences==
The Void of Shattering in Netease has only one major difference: you are able to revisit any memory you want from doing a single red shard. Simply visit the Shattering guide while in the void after doing a red shard event and click on the exclamation point for the memory you want to revisit and it will teleport you there.
