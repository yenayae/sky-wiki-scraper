''Sky: Children of the Light'' has a rich '''music''' component. In addition to an [[Original Sound Track]] that provides a variety of realm-dependent background music, players are able to perform music themselves.  Players can perform solo or in groups.  Even those who don't want to (or haven't been able to) get an instrument can enjoy listening to other skykids' performances.

== Overview ==
Dozens of different musical [[instruments]] are available to play. A simplified interface allows people to start playing without any music training. With [[Music Sheets]] and the [[Harmony Hall#Music Challenge|Music Challenge]], playing instruments can act as a rhythm mini-game. However, players can also choose to play whatever they want freeform.

Separate articles focus on the different elements of playing music.
