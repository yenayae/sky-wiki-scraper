The Whale Whisperer can be found in the [[Boneyard]], at the large [[Whales|Whale]] skeleton found to the left of the broken bridges, by the ruins of a building. This Spirit does not have a conventional [[Spirit Memories|memory]] quest; there is no kneeling figure that needs to be lit up.

Instead, the Spirit is triggered once all the [[Darkness|Darkness Plants]] covering the skeletal remains have been burned away. As it is exposed to the [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Rain|rain]], take care not to run out of light while burning the Darkness. All players in the area are then automatically granted the [[#Call|Whale Call]].<br>

==<span id="Expression">Call</span>==
The Whale Whisperer does not offer an [[Expression]], but instead offers a [[Call]]. The {{Emote||inline_text}} modifies the player's voice to a gentle honk.<br>

==Music Sheet==
The Whale Whisperer offers the {{Music Sheet|2}} [[Music Sheet]] #2, costing {{Cost|2 H}}. It is permanently available after unlocking the Spirit's [[Wing Buff]] and the Friendship Tree's fourth node. It is a song in the key of C Major.

Prior to Patch {{v|0.15.5}}, this was identified as Music Sheet #4. The pre-0.15.5 Music Sheet #2 is now labeled Music Sheet #5.<br>

==Trivia==
*[[Darkness|Darkness Plants]] covering the two ground entrances to the [[Tearful Light Miner]]'s cave, Darkness Plants on the [[Whale Whisperer]] covering the skeleton of the [[Boneyard]], and in the Rejecting Voyager's cave Darkness Plants in [[Isle of Dawn]] are Darknesses that cannot be burned by players with not enough [[Winged Lights]]. If a player try to burn Darkness Plants with less than 3 wedges for Whale Whisperer, less than 2 for Rejecting Voyager, and less than 1 for Tearful Light Miner, will receive a message that says, "You need more {{Icon|Four-point-star-Ray.png|link=}} to melt this."
