[[Instruments]] in Sky play [[music]] in different '''music keys''', so that all player music blends well with other music in the environment. These key changes happen automatically so that most players do not have to worry about it. However, experienced musicians may want to understand or control their instrument's key.

If you have selected a [[Music Sheet]] (or if someone nearby has selected one), your instrument's key will always be determined by the music sheet; see [[Music Sheets]] for all their keys.  Otherwise, your instrument's key matches the [[Original Sound Track|background music]], based on your current location, as detailed in [[#Finding Keys|Finding Keys]]

You can pause your key at any time by completely lowering the volume of the background music in the Audio Settings in-game.

[[File:Setting-menu-audio.png|x160px|thumb|none|Audio Settings]]

==Finding Keys==
Aside from selecting a [[Music Sheet]] to change your instrument's key, you can also get specific keys by going to certain areas that have the right notes in their background music. Below, you'll find suggested locations for specific keys. However, these are not the only places that support a specific key of your choice, though notably the most convenient.

Here is an infographic summarising this section, made by clement8978 on Discord.
[[File:Finding musical major scales in Sky by Clement.png|alt=An infographic depicting common areas where you can find each major scale in Sky|none|thumb|580x580px|Infographic by clement8978 on Discord (posted with permission)]]
If you prefer a video, here's a guide to help:[[File:Where to find all 12 major scales - Sky- Children of the Light|thumb|330x330px|none]]The [[Original Sound Track]] (OST) page does include the in-game keys for some tracks. If you are familiar with the game locations of the tracks and have access to the OST, that page may also be helpful.

===C major===
<!-- Only list music sheets that are always available -->
The majority of music sheets are in C major. These include Music Sheets {{Music Sheet|1|inline_text|label=1}}, {{Music Sheet|2|inline_text|label=2}}, {{Music Sheet|3|inline_text|label=3}}, {{Music Sheet|HH3|inline_text|label=HH3}}, {{Music Sheet|HH4|inline_text|label=HH4}}, {{Music Sheet|HH5|inline_text|label=HH5}}, and others.
Some places that give you the C major key include:
*[[Home|Homespace]].
*The Villages in [[Daylight Prairie#Eight Player Puzzle|Daylight Prairie]] before activating the bells.
*The Nightbird Whisperer cave in Prairie Peaks in [[Daylight Prairie#Eight Player Puzzle|Daylight Prairie]].
*The Underground Cavern in [[Hidden Forest#Forest Temple|Hidden Forest]].
*The Temple in [[Hidden Forest#Forest Temple|Hidden Forest]]. Mute the background music.
*The Harmony Hall by entering through [[Valley of Triumph#Citadel|Valley of Triumph]] or [[Aviary Village]]. Use the loop machine to set your key.
*The Treasure Reef in [[Golden Wasteland#Graveyard|Golden Wasteland.]]
*The Archives in [[Vault of Knowledge#First Floor .28Main.29|Vault of Knowledge]].

===C♯/D♭ major===
C sharp/D flat major is the key used when playing Music Sheet {{Music Sheet|34|inline_text|label=34}}.

Two spots that give the C♯/D♭ major key:
*The starting point for the 8-player puzzle in [[Daylight Prairie#Eight Player Puzzle|Daylight Prairie]]
*The Boneyard in [[Hidden Forest#Broken Bridge and Boneyard|Hidden Forest]]. Mute the background music.

Here are four areas which will set your key to D major:
*Go through the portal to [[Daylight Prairie]] from Home.
*The Temple in [[Valley of Triumph#Temple|Valley of Triumph]].
*The Battlefield in [[Golden Wasteland#Battlefield|Golden Wasteland]].

Here are three spots for playing with the key E♭ major:
*The Forest's Brook in [[Hidden Forest#Forest.27s Brook|Hidden Forest]]. Mute the background music.
*The Broken Temple in [[Winged Light (Children of Light)|Golden Wasteland]].
*The Crescent Oasis in [[Vault of Knowledge#First Floor .28Main.29|Vault of Knowledge]].

===E major===
If you have {{Music Sheet|16|inline_text}}, this is the most convenient way to get the E major key.

The Treehouse in [[Hidden Forest]], added in the [[Season of Assembly]], also plays E major after the music finishes. If you have finished all seasonal quests, you can also just go to that area. 

Otherwise, you can go to the [[Eye_of_Eden#Ascent_and_Orbit|end of '''Orbit''']], in the place where you exchange your stars for candles. (Don't walk too far into the level as the music will change.)

By using a technique (pausing your key) demonstrated in the video linked above, you can also play with E major in [[Eye of Eden|Eden]]. However, this requires being able to tell notes by ear. When the desired key is achieved (tested by playing an instrument), pause the in-game music by simply going to the Audio Settings and turning off the music.

The places that support F major include:
* The Shops in [[Aviary Village]].
* The Elevated Clearing in [[Hidden Forest#Sunny Forest|Hidden Forest]]. Mute the background music.
*The Citadel in [[Valley of Triumph#Citadel|Valley of Triumph]].
*The Village Theater in [[Valley of Triumph#Citadel|Valley of Triumph]].

===F♯/G♭ major===
The most convenient quiet place with F sharp/G flat major is the Boneyard in [[Hidden Forest]], after the Jellyfish have been released and the background music has finished. Though, there is also a section of the background music in the 8-player elevator in [[Daylight Prairie]] where the key for the instruments is G♭ major.

A place with G major is the clearing/Social Area in [[Hidden Forest]] after the background music has finished.<br>You can also go to the start of [[Isle of Dawn]].

===B major===
If you have Music Sheet {{Music Sheet|20|inline_text|label=20}} or {{Music Sheet|36|inline_text|label=36}}, this is the most convenient way to get the B major key.

Otherwise, you'll need to use a technique called "pausing your key" to play an instrument with this key. To do this, you'll need to be able to tell notes by ear. When the desired key is achieved (tested by playing an instrument), you can turn off the background music in Audio settings, at the right moment, to pause your key.

B major is part of the background music in:
* The Boneyard in [[Hidden Forest]]. Activate the Jellyfish - the beginning of the music will be in B major.
* Towards the end of a race in [[Valley of Triumph]]. A section towards the end of the music is in B major.
*The second Floor of [[Vault of Knowledge]]. A section of the music will be in B major.

==Sound Effects==
A lot of sounds are in tune with your key, including the call of your voice, the sound of forging candles, and some Expressions:

In an [https://fmod.com/blog/sky-children-of-the-light-interview interview with FMOD], the Sky sound designer mentioned this technical detail.

::'''Which technical detail are you most proud of?'''<br>'''Ritsu:''' The tone of many sound effects are pitch shifted in real-time according to the music key. This avoided subconscious player discomfort caused by discord between music and sound effect.

==Key by Location==
Note that an area which has no background music will not set your key to a new one.
