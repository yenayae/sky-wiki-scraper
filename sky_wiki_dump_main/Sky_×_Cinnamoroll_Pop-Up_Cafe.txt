<section begin="Summary" />A village isn't complete without a cafe, and it's finally time to open one in Sky. From '''Saturday, April 27, 2024 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' until '''Friday, May 17, 2024 at 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)''', join the collaboration event for the grand opening of [[Aviary Village]]’s new cafe, featuring the beloved [[wp:Sanrio|Sanrio]] character [[wp:Cinnamoroll|Cinnamoroll]]! This shy but friendly pooch knows a thing or two about cafes, and he’ll be in Aviary Village for a special three-week celebration welcoming Sky Kids to the newest gathering place in the kingdom.<section end="Summary" /><br>

<br>
Fly over to Aviary to help the [[Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer]] mark the grand opening of the cafe with a friendly visitor—none other than Cinnamoroll himself. This friendly puppy once had a life in the clouds—not unlike Sky Children. Complete themed [[Daily Quests]] as Cinnamoroll explores the area, pose and take some fabulous photos with him, take snapshots with the colorful decor, and of course, stop by the cafe counter to try some of the freshly baked [[Pieces of Light|Light]] pastries that Tiptoeing Tea-Brewer will be preparing for everyone at the start of every hour for 15 minutes.<br>

Looking simply for someone to do Daily Quests with? Or maybe some help for the [[Eye of Eden]]? You may find just the person to team up with while waiting for your order at the cafe.
