The Lightseeker Guide offered 1 Ultimate Gift, available for free by [[Season Pass]] holders after completing all [[Season of Lightseekers#Spirits and Cosmetics|Seasonal Spirits]] during the Season of Lightseekers only.

===Lightseekers Ultimate Prop===
The Lightseekers Ultimate [[Prop]] is a blue bioluminescent umbrella, decorated with a lighter blue spiral pattern on the canopy and little glowing light balls all around the umbrella's edges. When equipped, this umbrella is held by the player and provides protection from the [[Flora, Minerals and Elements of Sky#Rain|rain]]. It cannot be placed and therefore cannot be used in [[Shared Spaces]]. It was a [[Season Pass]] exclusive item during the Season, available for free from the Seasonal [[Constellation]] after completing all [[Season of Lightseekers#Spirits and Cosmetics|Seasonal Spirits]].<br>

==Friendship Tree==
Unlike later Ultimate Guides, the Lightseeker Guide did not have a Friendship Tree. Instead, the [[Lightseeker Guide#Ultimate Gifts|Ultimate Gift]] was obtained by clicking the flag in the middle of the Seasonal Constellation after completing all [[Season of Lightseekers#Spirits and Cosmetics|Seasonal Spirits]]. '''Now that the Season is over, their cosmetics are no longer available.'''

==Quest Tree==
Unlike later Ultimate Guides, the Lightseeker Guide did not have a Quest Tree since there were no Seasonal Quests.
