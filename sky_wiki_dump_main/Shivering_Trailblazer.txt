The Shivering Trailblazer can be found within the first gated courtyard in [[Forest Clearing]] where players first encounter [[Flora,_Minerals_and_Elements_of_Sky#Rain|rain]], in the back left corner. This Spirit is a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] quest with 5 memory fragments and an unlimited overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. It is also the first memory introduced where the Spirit can be [[Spirit Health|damaged]] (in this case, by the rain).

As their memory unfolds, the Shivering Trailblazer and another Spirit are seen dashing through Forest Clearing, taking shelter beneath the roof of the gated courtyard and the hollow tree roots beyond in a desperate attempt to avoid getting soaked by the rain.

At the end of the memory, the Shivering Trailblazer stands in front of a stone lantern tucked beneath the hollow roots of a tree. Chilled by the relentless rain despite their best efforts, the Spirit lets out a mighty sneeze and shivers miserably.<br>
