'''Days of Fortune''' is an annual event celebrating the traditions of the Lunar New Year festival that happens around the end of January and spans over the following 14 days.

During the two-week event, a brightly lit pier appears at the edge of the water in [[Home]] with Spirits from a past [[Seasonal Events|Season]] offering {{Icon|Icon_high_five.png|inline_text|label=High Fives|link=Friendship Menu#High Five}} and other Friend Actions to passing players. In addition to a number of firework shows, a special stone Dragon that drops [[Pieces of Light|Light]] to appears in Home for 8 minutes starting at the beginning of every even hour PST (UTC-8). The [[Secret Area]] is also open to everybody during this event, allowing players to enjoy its skating rink on the building's rooftop.

Lunar New Year-themed [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] are available from the in-game shop, and the Auspicious Visitor and Days of Fortune Event Staff offer various cosmetics from their Friendship Trees. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy_Traveler's_Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] and the present box on the roof of the Secret Area.

''For the occasion, a special gifting node shaped like an envelope {{Icon|Gift-5-hearts.png|link=|label=Fortune Gift Envelope}} also appears in the [[Friendship Menu]] of friends with whom a player has the {{Emote|Piggyback Lightseeker|inline_text}} unlocked, allowing you to gift them 5 [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] for {{Cost|14 C}} by meeting up in-game. The Fortune Gift Envelope can be given once a day per person, like regular Heart gifts and can be given in addition to regular Heart gifts, meaning players can send a maximum of 6 Hearts per day per friend.''

Days of Fortune returns for a fifth year! The event began '''Monday, January 29, 2024 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)'''  (11 days before LNY's Eve) and ended '''Wednesday, February 14, 2024 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)'''  (4 days after LNY)<ref name="fortune-2024-extended">Days of Fortune 2024 has been extended from February 11 to February 14, a response to the frequent crashing that Android players experienced in Patch {{v|0.24.3}}.</ref>, lasting '''17''' days. For the duration of the event, the Auspicious Visitor appears in [[Aviary Village]], offering to take players directly to the [[Valley of Triumph]]'s Social Space. In addition, the [[Secret Area]] is open to everyone through a friendly NPC at the gate. 

For the Year of the Dragon, the center of festivities takes place at Valley's [[Valley_of_Triumph#Social_Space|Social Space]], where players can pick up a bit of [[Social Light]] and meet a group of [[Season of Performance|Performance]] Spirits who are back to say hello during the event. Another familiar presence will show up at the '''start of every hour''', too: a felicitous flying dragon appears, bringing the best beats in Sky, some pyrotechnic Light, and a friendly race for Spirits and Sky Kids. At the countdown, join players from across the game servers with [[Festival Tech]] to race towards the [[Ice Rink]] alongside the felicitous dragon. Revel in twilight hues as night falls across the area for 10 minutes—the perfect backdrop for a party’s worth of fireworks and Light that the dragon will share.
<!---
TBA: Pictures of Valley at night during the race, the race end, and of the dragon costume spell platform -->

Need some more of that dragon energy in between those hourly appearances? There's a [[Spell]] for that. Back in Valley’s Social Space, a platform next to the Auspicious Visitor offers free Spells that give players a [[#Dragon Train Costume Spell|dragon costume]] for a limited time. Find other Sky Kids wearing this dragon costume and you can form a train of up to eight players (and before you ask, oh yes, the Spell stays active even in other levels).

For players wanting to gift something special to friends, there's the Fortune Gift Envelope! This special gifting node shaped like an envelope {{Icon|Gift-5-hearts.png|link=|label=Fortune Gift Envelope}} appears be in the [[Friendship Menu]] of friends with whom a player has the {{Emote|Piggyback Lightseeker|inline_text}} unlocked, allowing you to gift them 5 [[Currency#Hearts|Hearts]] for {{Cost|14 C}} by meeting up in-game. The Fortune Gift Envelope can be given once a day per person, like regular Heart gifts, and can be given in addition to regular Heart gifts, meaning players can send a maximum of 6 Hearts per day per friend. ''Please note that these gifts are not eligible to be doubled during the [[Double Currency Events#Days of Love - February 2024|Double Heart event]] that occurs for Days of Love.''

<small>Days of Fortune content was available to all players who have at least progressed to [[Valley of Triumph]] '''and''' started the [[Season of Revival#Quest #4|4th Quest]] from the [[Hopeful Steward]] in [[Aviary Village]].</small><br>

The Fortune Drum is red with a beige top and a large round body that sits on top of four brown legs. This [[Instrument]] was introduced in 2024 and was available for {{Cost|34 T|event=Fortune}} from the Auspicious Visitor at Valley's [[Valley_of_Triumph#Social_Space|Social Space]] or [[Aviary Village#Aviary Event Store|Aviary Village]] for the duration of the event.

The Fortune Drum plays the [[Music Sheet Parts|percussion part]] on Music Sheets. Unlike all other percussion Instruments, it offers only 4 sounds instead of the usual 8, all of which are unpitched sounds that do not correspond to different musical notes. Two sounds are for the actual drum noises; the other two are for secondary sounds made by hitting the sides of the drum or the drum sticks together.<br>
