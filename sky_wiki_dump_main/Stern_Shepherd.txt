== Memory ==
The [[Stern Shepherd]] can be found in [[The Last City]], at the very back of the area, in front of the [[Manatee]] enclosure.

Unlike other Spirits, the Stern Shepherd has no memory that can be relived, but rather a Seasonal Quest dedicated to them. As the city is besiged by Dark Creatures, this Quest gives players a series of tasks, helping the Spirit and themselves enter the Temple safely.

Players can interact with the Stern Shepherd without completing any Quests.

== <span id="Expression">Call</span> ==
This Spirit offers the {{Emote|Stern Shepherd|inline_text}}, which modifies the player's voice to a Manatee's call.
