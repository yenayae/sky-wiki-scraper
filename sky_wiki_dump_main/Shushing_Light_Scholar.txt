The Shushing Light Scholar can be found on the [[Vault of Knowledge#Fourth Floor|Fourth Floor]] in [[Vault of Knowledge]], on a floating platform to the left of the Isle of Dawn Constellation. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 10 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

In order to complete this Spirit Memory, players will have to carry the light up to the top of a series of platforms, which can pose to be difficult, as there is a high risk the light will fall down between a gap. It will be of help to exhibit patience and let the light touch the next platform before each jump, assuring that it will not fall down. For some higher plaforms, carefully coordinated flying can make it easier to advance.

As their memory unfolds, the Shushing Light Scholar can be seen making their way up to each platform, periodically assuming a praying pose throughout their journey. At the top, they once again stand a praying position alongside two other spirits.

At the end of the memory, the Shushing Light Scholar shushes the player by bringing their hand up to their mouth.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar slightly bend their knees and raise their right hand up to their mouth, while a "shhh" sound plays, overlayed with rhythmical clicking sounds.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with a few white sparkles flying up as your avatar raises their hand.
*Level 3 will make your avatar slightly bend their knees and raise their right hand up to their mouth while looking around, before bending their knees even further and bring both arms at shoulder level and motioning them up and down twice, while first a "shhh" sound, and then squaking sounds play.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with a few white sparkles flying up as your avatar raises their hand, and a small trail of light following each of their hands as they motion them up and down.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
