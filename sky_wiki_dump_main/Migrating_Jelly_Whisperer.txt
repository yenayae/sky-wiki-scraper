== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|Hk6kwA7ehWA|200px|inline|Video Guide}}

The Migrating Jelly Whisperer can be found in the [[Wind Paths]], on the main island, to the left of the [[Flight Guide]], behind an opening in the ground. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 9 memory fragments and a 12-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

As their memory unfolds, the Migrating Jelly Whisperer can be seen sneaking up on some [[Jellyfish]]. Once they're close, they climb up a ledge and jump into the middle of the unsuspecting Jellyfish flock, which immeditately scurry away, though not very far. The Whisperer watches as the Jellyfish leave, before the trying their luck again as they carefully follow the creatures to their new spot. This time, the Jellyfish spot the Spirit earlier, but as they begin to fly away, the Whisperer reaches out after them. The flock stops and turns around, coming back to the Migrating Jelly Whisperer. At last, their wish is granted as the flock lifts them up in the air, where the Spirit floats and dances amongst their newly found friends.

At the end of the memory, the Migrating Jelly Whisperer stands by the Jellyfish, jumping and performing pirouettes in the air. They stop their joyous dance to watch another group of small and big Jellyfish pass by and fly high up into the sky.

*Level 1 will make your avatar imitate a Jellyfish by jumping up and down, their feet pointed and their arms moving gracefully with each motion, while high-pitched tinkling sound effects play. After every second jump, the avatar will quickly turn around themselves once, before continuing to jump again. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with blue orbs flying up from the arms with each jump and turn, as well as a pink glowing lines trailing around the avatar's body on the latter.
*Level 3 will make your avatar dance on the spot, by smoothly moving their arms and knees in a fast-paced, wave-like motion, while an upbeat, laid-back melody plays.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with white bubbles rising from the spot where the avatar stands.
<!--As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Heart|4}}, {{Heart|3}}, and {{Heart|6}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.-->
