Quest by Quest, Sky Kids are making [[Aviary Village]] a new space for Spirits and players alike to gather. Now that it’s beginning to thrive, it’s time to celebrate that achievement with a bang! '''Aviary's Firework Festival''' began '''Monday, November 27, 2023 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and continued until '''Sunday, December 17, 2023 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''21''' days.

Brilliant lights, dazzling colors, and thrilling music combine to mark the first chapter of Aviary Village’s new life, and the special role that Sky Kids have played to make it flourish. The event will come in two phases, with two weeks of preparation and one week of [[Aviary’s Firework Festival#The Finale|showtime]]:

* Phase One: From '''November 27''' through '''December 11''', players collect Tickets and help the Enchanted Pyrotechnician gather materials to use in the festival. (''Players must complete Season of Revival's [[Season of Revival#Quest #3|3rd Quest]]<ref name="Revival Quest changes">Prior to the {{v|0.25.0}} Update, the [[Season of Revival]]'s 3rd and 7th Quest were labeled as the 4th and 8th Quest. At this time, the second Seasonal Quest involved unlocking the [[Blessings_(Spells)#Message_Boat_Spell|Message Boat Spells]] inside the Enchantment Guide's [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Spell Shop]] in Aviary Village. This Quest was then removed from the [[Hopeful Steward]]'s Quest Tree, reducing the total number of Revival Quests from ten to nine, while also changing the numbered order of the subsequent Quests.</ref> to participate.'')
* Phase Two: From '''December 12''' through '''December 17''', the [[Hopeful Steward]] will call the village Spirits together for the fireworks show every '''four hours''', starting at '''00:00 PST (UTC-8)'''. (''Players must complete Season of Revival's [[Season of Revival#Quest #7|7th Quest]]<ref name="Revival Quest changes" /> to participate.'')

<br>
During this event, two special starter bundles are added as permanent [[Premium Candle Shop|IAPs]] and the Enchanted Pyrotechnician Spirit offers two cosmetics from their Friendship Tree. In addition, free [[Spells]] to try all of these items can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy%20Traveler's%20Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] at [[Home]].

''Note: The fireworks rocket Tickets and IGC (in-game currency) cosmetics will only be available during Phase One of the event. Aviary’s Firework Festival is not currently planned to return, but the Festival Scepter and Festival Earrings will be brought back in the future in a different format.''

==The Finale==
[[File:Aviary-Festival-Meditation-Circle.jpg|thumb|250px|The Festival meditation circle]]
Every '''four hours''' in [[Aviary Village]], starting '''December 12, 2023 at 00:00 PST (UTC-8)''' and ending '''December 17, 2023 at 20:00 PST (UTC-8)''', the [[Hopeful Steward]] and the Enchanted Pyrotechnian will call everyone together for the Firework Festival Finale. Sit at the meditation circle that appears by the large, floating staff near the Realm portals to join in the celebration. The Finale is around 10 minutes long and [[Festival Tech]] is enabled for the duration of the show, allowing players to enjoy the spectacle alongside a crowd. During the show, each shop is blocked off by a Spirit Gate requiring '''one (1)''' Spirit from the [[Isle of Dawn]]. 

The show begins with the Hopeful Steward running down the street of the village, drawing out the various Seasonal Guides that have taken up residence within Aviary to stand outside their respective shops. The Hopeful Steward then leads the [[Enchantment Guide]], the [[Dreams Guide]], the [[Abyss Guide]], and the [[Performance Guide]] to walk back towards the Realm portals, once by one, where they all stand together and begin shooting off a dazzling array of fireworks. 

There are plenty of spots on the hills and ridges to settle in with friends and watch colors and lights splash across the sky or be part of the show itself, soaring through the air as the display is set off. Players can also ignite the racks of unused fireworks on either side of the [[Realm]] portals for an extra splash of color.

Towards the conclusion of the show, the Hopeful Steward will take a large staff in hand to shoot off the last few huge bursts of fireworks that draw in any nearby players to toss them into the air. Once finished, the four Guides and the Hopeful Steward will sit together and admire the restored village beneath the beautiful night sky.

While Aviary’s Firework Festival is not currently planned to return, going forward in 2024 the '''Firework Finale''' itself will come back on the '''first day of each month''' on the same four-hour rotation — just in case you want to celebrate a little festival magic again with friends.
