== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|PSttOiSBiys|thumb|inline|Video Guide}}

The Jolly Geologist can be found in the [[Prairie Peaks]], in a cave located at the far right of the area. Follow a little path leading to a cave at the base of a mountain, where the Spirit is located inside its entrance. This Spirit has a [[Standard Memory|standard memory]] with 7 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

As their memory unfolds, the Jolly Geologist can be seen walking through the cave, collecting luminescent minerals dotted throughout its cavities. Wandering further into the cave, the Spirit spots light coming from an underground water source. Curious, the Jolly Geologist jumps into the water to investigate and swims through a tunnel leading to a large cavern. Awaiting inside is a huge structure of minerals that illuminates the surroundings in a dazzling display of natural beauty.

At the end of the memory, the Jolly Geologist cannot contain their joy and does a jaunty victory dance, celebrating their greatest find.

*Level 1 will make your avatar hunch their back and bring their elbows outwards, before doing a little dance by jumping in the air, both arms bending and legs kicking from one side to the other white a jaunty castanet sound effect plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar.
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1, with glowing blue sparkles coming out of your avatar's handsevery second kick, and glowing golden sparkles coming out of their feet with every jump.
*Level 3 will make your avatar jump up, before imitating a rope wrangling movement with one hand while looking around, legs kicking from one side to the other in a rhythmic movement, while a castanet and banjo melody plays. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your avatar. When doing so, your avatar will finish off by jumping and twirling in the air once.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3, with glowing orange sparkles bursting from your avatar's lifted hand, as well as a trail of smoke swirling up from the hand's motion.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.
