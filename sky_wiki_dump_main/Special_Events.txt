{{Distinguish|1=Double Currency Events}}
'''Special Events''' (also called '''Holiday Events''') were first introduced into the game in October of 2019. These are limited-time (typically one- to two-week) events introducing new [[cosmetics]] themed around real-life celebrations. Most Special Events recur annually (although the exact dates can vary by several weeks from year to year). Some of these events take place in the [[Secret Area|Secret Area]], accessible from the Vault of Knowledge. They are separate from, but may overlap with, [[Seasonal Events]] and [[Double Currency Events]].

[[File:Qixi-Festival-NetEase.jpg|left|thumb|275x275px|Qixi Festival]]
An unannounced event took place in the Elevated Clearing at the Hidden Forest. The Qixi Festival of "Light Encounter" (The Chinese version of Sky from Netease) officially started on '''August 4, 2022, 2023 and 2024''' and for the occasion, birds gathered to form a bridge guiding two lovers to reunite warmly. Although no official announcement was made, the two ancestors were visible in the Global Sky version for 24 hours. From '''0:00 PDT (UTC-7)''', the two ancestors approached each other on the bridge where the birds gathered and by the end of the day they embraced each other to express their joy and longing for their reunion. None of the other activities from the Chinese event took place in the Global server and was most likely caused by a bug.
