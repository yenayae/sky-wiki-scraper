Days of Mischief was back for a fifth year in a row! The event began on '''Monday, October 23, 2023 at 00:00 PDT (UTC-7)''' and ended on '''Sunday, November 12, 2023 at 23:59 PST (UTC-8)''', lasting '''21''' days. For the duration of the event, the Herald of Mischief appeared in [[Home]], offering to take players directly to [[The Cackling Crab]].

[[The Cackling Crab]] transformed each week of the 3-week event, as Spirits moved around and even learned to play tricks of their own.

For the occasion, the [[Dark Crabs|Crabs]] have taken over! Watch your step as you explore The Cackling Crab, as a new underground cave and two mazes have been added to the area, filled with tricks, treats, and even some [[Pieces of Light|Light]] to discover. There are three phases, each spanning a week:

* Phase One: The Crabs have captured Skidmore and a new unnamed Spirit (wearing [[Tumbling Troublemaker#Hair|Tumbling Troublemaker]]'s Hair, [[Abyss Guide#Ultimate Headpiece|Abyss Guide]]'s Ultimate Head Accessory, [[Ceasing Commodore#Cape|Ceasing Commodore]]'s Cape, [[Anxious Angler#Outfit|Anxious Angler]]'s Outfit, the [[Lazy Days#Seashell Hairpin|Seashell Hairpin]], and the [[Remembrance Guide#Crab Plush|Crab Plush]] Prop) provides the Krill Cat's Curse Spell.
* Phase Two: Skidmore is freed and "Jenova" escapes his own prison, transforming into a Crab that provides the Crab Curse Spell.
* Phase Three: Samantha, Yoshi, and Nat are freed from the influence of the Crabs, while Jenova is once again back in his jail. The mischievous Krill Cat that orchestrated the devious events now provides the Crab Curse Spell.

With Patch {{v|0.23.0}}, TGC originally changed how older IAP and IGC (in-game currency) event items were brought back: starting with Days of Mischief this year, each event would offer IAP and IGC from the current year and the previous year, and items older than the previous year would be made available on a separate schedule outside their related event. '''However, on October 27, they reverted this change'''<ref>https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/1239-patch-notes---october-12-2023---0-23-0-232737-android-ios-huawei-232287-ps4-switch/#days-of-mischief</ref>. For Days of Mischief 2023, this means that:
*All prior IGC items will be available for all platforms
*All prior IAP items will be available for iOS and Android platforms (unfortunately these are the only platforms that items can be returned to within the timeframe of the event)
*For Days of Feast and all events after Days of Mischief, all items from current and prior years will be offered together during their event.

<small>Days of Mischief content is available to all players who have progressed to at least Vault of Knowledge.</small>
