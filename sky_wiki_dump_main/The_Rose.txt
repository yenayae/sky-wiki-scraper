==Additional Cosmetics==
This item was available only during the [[Season of The Little Prince]], after the [[Season of The Little Prince#Finale|Final Quest]] had been completed.<br>'''This item is no longer available.'''

===Sword Outfit===
The Sword [[Outfit]] is a fitted, cream-coloured suit with wide cuffs, a yellow belt and a round, light-blue piece of fabric on the front of the neck. It has black, high boots and a silver sword, attached on the player's right side. Since the Sword is part of the Outfit, it is non-functional. Upon completing the [[Season of The Little Prince#Quest #7|seventh Quest]] of the Season of The Little Prince, it was available to collect for 200 {{Cost|C}} through [[The Rose]]'s Quest Tree. No [[Season Pass]] or other [[IAP]] purchase were necessary for this collaboration item. It later returned in 2025 for the [[Days of Bloom#March 2025|Sky x Le Petit Prince Encore]] event. <small>(Since this item is part of a limited collaboration, it is not scheduled to return in future years.)</small><br>

==Trivia==
* The Rose Music Box is a tribute to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince#Rose The Rose] in the book "The Little Prince".
* The Rose is referred to as "she" in seasonal quests. During the Fourth quest in the [[Season of The Little Prince]], the Little Prince says "I listened to my rose when she grumbled, or boasted... or even sometimes when she said nothing." 
**The Rose is one of the few characters to be referred to with gendered pronouns. ''This is not indicative of a Spirit's canonical gender.'' See [[Ancestors#Gender|here for more information]].
