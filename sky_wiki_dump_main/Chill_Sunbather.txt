== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|197tor-WWVo||inline|Video Guide}}

The Chill Sunbather can be found in [[Sanctuary Islands]], next to a [[Darkness|Darkness Plant]] outside a cave on the front right side of the main island. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry Spirit memory]] with 10 memory fragments and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]].

During the memory, the Spirit must be carried through the depths of the cave, up a winding path leading to a [[Children_of_Light#Sanctuary_Islands_(8)|Child of Light]], and then back out again. This cave is home to many [[Dark Crabs]] so repeated [[Deep Call|Deep Calls]] are recommended to prevent them from knocking players out of the Spirit's circle.

As their memory unfolds, the Chill Sunbather can be seen exploring the cave at a leisurely pace alongside the [[Sanctuary Guide]], seeming unconcerned about the danger presented by the Dark Crabs. As the Spirit makes their way up the spiraling path towards its end, a mischievous pair of Crabs scuttle away with the Chill Sunbather's hat and sunglasses, prompting an alarmed Sanctuary Guide to chase after them to retrieve the stolen items. Unbothered by the theft, the Chill Sunbather continues traveling, eventually making their way back outside of the cave's entrance.

At the end of the memory, the Chill Sunbather stands within the cave at the bottom of the winding path, relaxed and idly scratching their belly despite missing both their cape along with their hat and sunglasses. The Sanctuary Guide jogs up to the Spirit to hand over the recovered items, which the Chill Sunbather accepts with little fanfare. Dressed once again in their tropical attire, the Spirit returns to idly scratching their belly as the Sanctuary Guide shakes their head with exasperation.<br>

*Level 1 will make your avatar lean back, head tilted to periodically look around, and scratch their belly with their right hand while a low squeaky sound effect plays with every scratch. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character. Exiting this Expression will make your avatar heartily pat their belly with a nod while a drum sound effect plays. 
*Level 2 makes the same motion as Level 1 with sparkles appearing from the avatar's scratching hand, and a glowing blue halo surrounding the same hand during the final pat gesture.
*Level 3 will make your avatar lean back exaggeratedly, head tilted to periodically look around, and pat their belly with both hands while a hollow drum sound effect plays with every pat. This action is continued for as long as you don't move your character.
*Level 4 makes the same motion as Level 3 with sparkles appearing from the avatar's hands.

As a Traveling Spirit, the prices of the three Expression upgrades were the standard {{Cost|4 H}}, {{Cost|3 H}}, and {{Cost|6 H}}. During the Season, Levels 2 and 4 were free, but were only available to [[Season Pass]] holders.

===Prop===
The [[Prop]] offered by this Spirit is a gray reclining beach lounge, costing {{Cost|20 C}} from the Traveling Spirit. It is a placeable Prop that can be used to decorate [[Shared Spaces]]. Unlike most other chairs, this item does not offer the ability to [[Chat]] with other players - it is purely cosmetic and does not offer any functionality. It appears as a miniature recliner on its owner's back when carried.

This item was not available during the [[Season of Sanctuary]]. Instead, it was added to the Chill Sunbather's Friendship Tree during their first visit as a Traveling Spirit on August 19, 2021, in conjunction with [[Days of Summer]]. During this event, a 30-minute preview Spell of the Prop ({{Icon|Days_of_summer_long_chair_spell.png|link=|label=Beach Recliner Prop Spell}}) was also available for free.<br>

==Trivia==
*The Chill Sunbather is the first [[Traveling Spirit]] to have a video teaser instead of the usual silhouette image before it arrived.
*The Chill Sunbather sold the event In-App Purchases during [[Days of Nature]]. During [[Additional_Light_Sources#Sunset_Sanctuary_Turtle|Sunset]] in [[Sanctuary Islands]], they could be found roaming the island that hosted the event; interacting with them in this time period allowed items to be purchased.
**A bug at the end of Days of Nature 2022 caused the Chill Sunbather to still roam the island during Sunset once the event ended. An interaction icon still appeared over the Spirit's head, and clicking on it displayed a message saying you've bought everything the Spirits has to offer. This was shown regardless of whether you ever purchased any of the event cosmetics. The bug has since been fixed.
