Note: In-game key refers to the predominant musical key(s) that the game's musical instruments are set to, when the particular track is played. It does not refer to the actual key of the whole song. These lists do not include keys for cutscenes, since you cannot open instruments while watching a cutscene.

=== Sky: Concert in the Light ===
Unlike the abovementioned tracks released officially by thatgamecompany, thatgamecompany has collaborated with artist AURORA with some of the in-game original soundtracks, which are included in the album '''Sky: Concert in the Light''' released by AURORA in December 8th, 2022. Many songs in this album have already been released long before Season of AURORA, which were meticulously selected by thatgamecompany to match the atmosphere at each music scene in the concert and the background stories of the game. Some collaborated tracks are used outside the AURORA concert experience to replace music in the launch edition (for example, ''track 17 Constellation'' is used at the credit after Eden run to replace the original launch edition in soundtrack Volume 1) . However, some of the intros and outros in this album cannot be found in the game.
