The collectibles [[Respectful Pianist#Traveling Spirit|offered]] by this Spirit are a {{Spirit Item|Respectful Pianist|Mask|inline_text}}, a {{Spirit Item|Respectful Pianist|Hair|inline_text}}, and the {{Spirit Item|Respectful Pianist|Instrument|label=Winter Piano Instrument|inline_text}}.<section end="Summary" />

== Memory ==
<div>{{#ev:youtube|A5rrM_cZWI0||inline|Video Guide by Tara}}

The Respectful Pianist can be found the Wasteland's [[Graveyard]] in a round hollow boulder between the large Darkness Tree and the passage to the Battefield. This Spirit has a [[Carry Spirit Memory|carry spirit memory]] with 4 memory fragements and a 15-minute overall [[Timed Memory|time limit]]. 

This Spirit memory can be difficult to complete, as several Dark Dragons roam the area. It is advisable to wait before a Dark Dragon has just passed before advancing to the next memory fragement. Bringing a friend as a precaution can also be of help  in case you are attacked by a Dark Dragon, or for luring them away. 

Another thing to note is to preferably ''not'' burn the Dark Plants leading up to the cave containing butterflies, as they can act as a helpful staircase towards the last memory fragement. Alternatively, players can carefully and slowly fly alongside the outer wall, carrying the light with them.

As their memory unfolds, the Respectful Pianist can be seen making their way across the Graveyard, ending on a high ledge above the tunnel filled with butterflies and a Darkness Plant in its center. 

At the end of the memory, the Respectful Pianist puts a hand to their chest and bows their head towards the player in a solemn acknowledgment, as if respecting them for walking into danger to free them.<br>
