<section begin="Summary" />
'''Days of Color''' (formerly known as '''Days of Rainbow''') is an annual charity event celebrating diversity, unity, and hope that usually happens around mid-June and lasts until the beginning of July, loosely coinciding with [[wp:LGBT pride|Pride Month]]. As part of the celebrations, ''Sky'' encourages players to make a difference in the real world by partnering with charities that champion equality and support marginalized communities, to whom they donate part of the net profit from [[IAP]] sales.<section end="Summary" />

During the event, rainbows are added to the skies of [[Home]] and throughout the [[Realms]] with two types of rainbow-themed [[Quests#Days of Color|Daily Quests]]. Players can also find a puzzle involving [[#Cape Color Categorization|Cape colors]] and a special geyser that grants colorful [[Spells]] in the [[Eight-Player Puzzle Area]]. Completing this puzzle unlocks access to a special location high above the clouds—and rewards a bit of [[Pieces of Light|Light]] in the process.

Rainbow-themed IAPs are available from the in-game shop, and the Color Guide Spirit offers various cosmetics from their Friendship Tree. Free [[Spells]] to try all of these items (alongside [[#Rainbow Spell|Rainbow]] and [[#Trail Spells|Trail Spells]]) can also be collected from the [[Spell Shops#Sleepy Traveler's Boat|Sleepy Traveler's boat]] at Home, the [[Aviary Village#Spell Shop|Spell Shop]] in Aviary Village, or the Color Gift Box found at the event area.

Behind the two Guides at Home, over the water, was a double rainbow that slowly spawned [[Pieces of Light]]. Each piece of light was a different color and briefly changed your trail into the corresponding color. Large floating Jellyfish around the double rainbow were available to help players recharge.

==Trivia==
*Days of Rainbow 2020 was not available in the [[NetEase|Chinese version]] of ''Sky'': instead, the Days of Dragon Boat took its place. In 2021, Days of Rainbow was introduced in the Chinese version of ''Sky'', renamed 缤纷飞行日 (roughly translates to "Colorful Flight Day"), from November 18 to December 1, 2021. The Chinese version does not include the [[#Rainbow Pack|Rainbow Pack]] IAP.
* Although [[wp:Rainbow#Double_rainbows|double rainbows]] do really occur in nature, the double rainbow that appears at [[Home]] during the event is not realistic. In real double rainbows, the colors of the outer rainbow are reversed (red on the inside of the arc and violet on the outside).
